**Misc Notes**: 

- We all agreed on the name, and we need to decide on initial tech dependencies. Not only HTML and CSS, the language of C, SQL, and a server. A lot of research is needed since the requirements of the tech used will change.
- Specific group could be our college friends, but we could just have college kids in general. We’re talking about a website for college kids discounts. When we think about college kids, we think of ramen, broke, etc. slogan could be “don't break your bank!”. Could call it “College Discountz”.
