1. Summary of Activities

**Aaron**:

In Tuesday's meeting, we collectively refined our vision for the project, leading me to draft a thorough system description. During Thursday's follow-up session, I assisted the team in dissecting my system description and contributed to the logistics of generating our class diagram. Updates were made to classes not initially detailed in my system description; I documented these changes and forwarded them to Chase. With my feedback, Chase amended the text to correspond with our newly revised class diagram. My appreciation this week is directed toward Chase for adeptly navigating my occasionally disorganized notes. Lastly, owing to an accidentally incorrect domain purchase I made last week, we are rebranding our group to StudentDiscountz.
