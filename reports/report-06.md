1. Summary of Activities

**Aaron**:

In Tuesday's meeting, we collectively refined our vision for the project, leading me to draft a thorough system description. During Thursday's follow-up session, I assisted the team in dissecting my system description and contributed to the logistics of generating our class diagram. Updates were made to classes not initially detailed in my system description; I documented these changes and forwarded them to Chase. With my feedback, Chase amended the text to correspond with our newly revised class diagram.  

**Elizabeth**:

For this week, I downloaded Django and ReactJS in order to set up what I needed to jump-start the beginning of the coding process. During the meeting, I participated in the creation of the UML diagrams and establishing each part of the functionality on the website. Though we didn't start coding this week, I discussed with the team about the different frameworks we wanted to use. This includes ReactJS, Django, Backbone, and Bootstrap. I also touched base on how the front page is going to be designed, which has helped our project become more crystallized.

**Ceanna**
This week, I was in charge of creating the UML diagram. In our meeting, we sat down drew on the whiteboard, and talked about how the diagram should look throughout the meeting. As we were talking about the UML diagram I was simultaneously drawing the diagram on my laptop using the Drawio program. I communicated with Chase and Aaron to make sure that we were on the same page about any changes to the UML diagram, so I could update it. Once the meeting was over, I set up the slides for the presentation so we could start preparing for next week. As for coding this week, I downloaded a couple of programs so that we could start coding as soon as possible. Those programs were Django and ReactJS and I played around with them to see how they work so I can get a better idea before we start coding.
