## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

In Tuesday's meeting, we collectively refined our vision for the project, leading me to draft a thorough system description. During Thursday's follow-up session, I assisted the team in dissecting my system description and contributed to the logistics of generating our class diagram. Updates were made to classes not initially detailed in my system description; I documented these changes and forwarded them to Chase. With my feedback, Chase amended the text to correspond with our newly revised class diagram.  

### **Elizabeth**:

For this week, I downloaded Django and ReactJS in order to set up what I needed to jump-start the beginning of the coding process. During the meeting, I participated in the creation of the UML diagrams and establishing each part of the functionality on the website. Though we didn't start coding this week, I discussed with the team about the different frameworks we wanted to use. This includes ReactJS, Django, Backbone, and Bootstrap. I also touched base on how the front page is going to be designed, which has helped our project become more crystallized.

### **Ceanna**

This week, I was in charge of creating the UML diagram. In our meeting, we sat down drew on the whiteboard, and talked about how the diagram should look throughout the meeting. As we were talking about the UML diagram I was simultaneously drawing the diagram on my laptop using the Drawio program. I communicated with Chase and Aaron to make sure that we were on the same page about any changes to the UML diagram, so I could update it. Once the meeting was over, I set up the slides for the presentation so we could start preparing for next week. As for coding this week, I downloaded a couple of programs so that we could start coding as soon as possible. Those programs were Django and ReactJS and I played around with them to see how they worked so I could get a better idea before we started coding.

### **Jessica**

This week, I was able to meet with the team to create the diagrams as well as create a webpage template for our Presentation on Wednesday. I also downloaded Django and React so we can start the necessary coding process for the following week. It was important to get the webpage template done so we can have a visual aspect to show for the midterm presentation, hence why that was my main focus this week aside from contributing to the new deliverable and trying to reformat the way we do report to accurately work as a team.

### **Chase**

This week I helped create the diagram for the second part of the deliverable, as well as updated the markdown for the first part of the deliverable. I also helped plan the new agenda, discussed future meetings, and developed an idea for the group presentation. On top of this, I did some research on our decided frameworks to get a better understanding of how they work.

### **Jennie**

This week I was able to sort out better deadlines for our deliverable and report this week by making sure that we broke down the deliverable earlier in the week and made sure the team had better communication compared to previous weeks. At the beginning of the week, I told the team to download the frameworks that we had in mind which in this case were Django and ReactJS, this had to be done before our Tuesday night meeting which I was able to accomplish. Then for Thursday's meeting, I provided some input towards the diagram throughout the meeting's duration. Once the meeting was over, I communicated with Aaron and Chase to communicate with each other about the updates to the description of the deliverable since we did make changes to the map. Then I created the template for this week's report and was able to keep everyone on track about both the deliverable and the report. As for coding this week, the main priority was to download the frameworks and start to get ideas on how the home page should look.

## 2. Project Retrospective

This week has improved a lot compared to the previous weeks, we did not struggle as much with collaboration on Deliverable 3, once we decided as a team, to do it together, in more than one meeting this week. We were able to take what Aaron wrote for the System Description and provide feedback on it. Then we were able to implement what he wrote into the UML diagram. We were able to break it down sentence by sentence to get the full meaning and collaborate with each other throughout the meeting on how the diagram should look. This was a success since we were able to work effectively as a group and always used our time wisely throughout both meetings this week. The only real issue this week was downloading the framework at a certain point and consistently being on the same page on the final days of the assignments.

### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Ceanna did an amazing job editing the UML diagram and helped Aaron and Chase update the description of the model.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Jennie for taking charge this week, making sure that we had a goal this week, and hitting the mark.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: My appreciation this week is directed toward Chase for adeptly navigating my occasionally disorganized notes.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Aaron for helping me modify the deliverable. I also appreciate Ceanna for helping me with the daigram, and Jennie for keeping us organized.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Ceanna and Chase did a great job this week working on sorting out the diagram.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: Jessica and Elizabeth did a great job this week with keeping up on the notes throughout both our meetings this week. 

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: We are on track to meeting our goals and the communication has improved.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We as a group are using GitHub more this week.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: Communication has improved. We all have a much better idea of what's going on.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think our group is properly utilizing GitHub and is communicating better.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: We were finally able to establish a solid base for communication on how reports and deliverables should be done.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think we did a way better job this week on working through GitHub for the assignments and had much better communication. 

### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: It was difficult to make some decisions.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Django and ReactJS had a hard time downloading on some people's computers.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: I bought the domain name studentdiscountz last week rather than collegediscountz, so we're changing our name.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I had a hard time getting some frameworks to install.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: We had a deadline of 12:00 p.m. for all the things due for the team which I failed to reach.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I attempted to give the deadline of 12 p.m. for both the deliverable and the report to be completely done but it did not work out that way.


### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Discussing and setting up the frameworks is taking longer than expected.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Having a hard time working around GitHub, and making sure that we do not have any merger errors. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: Markdown is still not being used enough.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: Understanding how to use certain frameworks is proving to be a little challenging.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Learning how to use Adobe Illustrator for the webpage design, and ultimately switching to html and css.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: Still need to work through GitHub more since we did improve this week but I think it could be better.


### **What should we do next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think we could use ClickUp to be more organized with tasks and where we are in the process. 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We should talk more about how we are going to break the code for next week.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: More Markdown, more Github, and we need to look ahead to our MVP that's due on the 29th.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I believe we should discuss how we are going to split up the code and the presentation for next week.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Officially start the website and learn to use GitHub better for the project.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: Definitely need to use GitHub more and have a better communication system about it.

   
## 3. Next Steps

Coming up this week we do have our midterm presentation, so that will be our main focus at the start of this week. As a team going forward, we are also going to do Tuesday night meetings in addition to our Thursday night meetings since it worked well this last week. That way, it will be more manageable and productive, even if the activity does not fully need teamwork, members can use this time as code time since we all have chaotic schedules and have a better communication setting as well. Lastly, a discussion of code will take place this week where team members will be assigned what part of the website they need to code for through either Django or ReactJS that were downloaded this week. Since Jessica created a webpage template for this week, it is going to be discussed further this coming week so everyone has an idea going forward on how the homepage should look. Going forward, our code and assignments will be going through GitHub and code should not be sent outside of GitHub.
