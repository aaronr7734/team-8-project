1. Summary of Activities

**Aaron**:

In Tuesday's meeting, we collectively refined our vision for the project, leading me to draft a thorough system description. During Thursday's follow-up session, I assisted the team in dissecting my system description and contributed to the logistics of generating our class diagram. Updates were made to classes not initially detailed in my system description; I documented these changes and forwarded them to Chase. With my feedback, Chase amended the text to correspond with our newly revised class diagram. My appreciation this week is directed toward Chase for adeptly navigating my occasionally disorganized notes. Lastly, owing to an accidentally incorrect domain purchase I made last week, we are rebranding our group to StudentDiscountz.

**Elizabeth**:

For this week, I downloaded Django and ReactJS in order to set up what I needed to jump start the beginning of the coding process. During the meeting, I participated in the creation of the UML diagrams and establishing each part of functionality on the website. Though we didn't start coding this week, I discussed with team about the different frameworks we wanted to use. This includes ReactJS, Django, Backbone, and Bootstrap. I also touched base on how the front page is going to be designed, which has helped our project become more crystallized.

2. Project Retrospective

**Appreciations**: Chase did an amazing job edited the UML diagram and helped Aaron update the description of the model.

**Successes**: We are on track to meeting our goals and the communication has improved.

**Failures**: It was difficult to make some decisions.

**Barriers**: Discussing and setting up the frameworks is taking longer than expected.

**What should we do next time**: I think we could use ClickUp to be more organized with tasks and where we are in the process.
