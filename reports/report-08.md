## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I worked on the front-end side of the website and created a sketch of how the website would look like. For the deliverable, I worked on the Introduction section and the adopted technologies section where I talked about what frameworks/languages we’re going to use. A couple of things that I am having trouble with are my commits, and how my name in GitHub is my full name and not my user name. At  Tuesday’s meeting, Jess helped me figure out my GitHub so that it could work properly. During the meeting, we finally decided to use Bootstrap for the framework after some careful consideration. As soon as it was confirmed that we were using BootStrap, I downloaded the rest of the necessary framework in the meeting. After we had our discussion about frameworks sorted out, we talked about the design of the home page and voted on what design would suit the concept of college discounts. Once we found out how we wanted the home page to look as a whole, me and the rest of the frontend team broke up the homepage into sections to work on. I was in charge of the header, in which I added the Nau logo, the name, and two buttons on the right for the signup and login. As I started to incorporate BootStrap into my code, I found out that I need to have certain links that need to be in the code in order for it to work. 


### **Jessica**:


### **Chase**:
This week I made a lot of progress on both the webstie and the deliverable. I was responsible for the look and feel, and license sections of the deliverable. I also helped Ceanna with the adopted technology section. I needed to research licenses and eventually pitched the MIT license as I thought it was the best fit. I also made sure the UI for the project was functional so I could complete the look and feel section. Albeit, we could not style all the pages to our liking. As for the website, I was responsible for creating the sign up, login, and category pages. I was also tasked with making sure each page was functional and linked properly to the homepage. Once linked, I made sure the login and sign up pages properly utilized user data to accomplish their specific objectives. On top of this, I was present for both the Tuesday and Thursday meetings and helped our team assign deadlines and plan future goals. I believe we got a lot done this week and am proud of the quality and quantity of the work that was done.

   Jessica's Thoughts:  
   
   Jennie's Thoughts:

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We were able to get the code this week onto the website. I can see our idea coming to life. We are working as a team, and communicating everything that we talk about. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: We were able to make a lot of progress in a short amount of time. Our website came together fast and we are all working together to build it piece by piece.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts:


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts:
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I was working in git bash, and my username was my full name for the longest time. GitHub did not see that it was me for the longest time. Now I figured out how to move about GitHub better now. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
   The last few days before the due date were hectic as we had too much to do and needed to catchup a little bit. I do not think we managed our time well enough this week and so we ended up almost biting off more than we could chew. 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 

### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   Ceanna's Thoughts: So when we code only one person can work on the front end of the website at a time so that we do not mess up other people's code. We are waiting for people to finish the code.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts:
   
   Chase's Thoughts: Due to the time crunch, we had all members of our group pushing and pulling the github at the same time. With everyone so busy, having to constantly check, approve, and make pull requests was a nuisance.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 

   
### **What should we try next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: When are talking about code, and how to split it up into groups. I feel that we should time it out for a couple of more days. So that we are not so overwhelmed for the next week to come.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   
   Chase's Thoughts: We should definitely come up with a game plan and act on that plan sooner. I think it would be best to avoid scrambling to get everything done in time.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:
