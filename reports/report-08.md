## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**:


### **Ceanna**:
This week, I worked on the front-end side of the website and created a sketch of how the website would look like. For the deliverable, I worked on the Introduction section and the adopted technologies section where I talked about what frameworks/languages we’re going to use. A couple of things that I am having trouble with are my commits, and how my name in GitHub is my full name and not my user name. At  Tuesday’s meeting, Jess helped me figure out my GitHub so that it could work properly. During the meeting, we finally decided to use Bootstrap for the framework after some careful consideration. As soon as it was confirmed that we were using BootStrap, I downloaded the rest of the necessary framework in the meeting. After we had our discussion about frameworks sorted out, we talked about the design of the home page and voted on what design would suit the concept of college discounts. Once we found out how we wanted the home page to look as a whole, me and the rest of the frontend team broke up the homepage into sections to work on. I was in charge of the header, in which I added the Nau logo, the name, and two buttons on the right for the signup and login. As I started to incorporate BootStrap into my code, I found out that I need to have certain links that need to be in the code in order for it to work. 


### **Jessica**:
This week after adding functionality to the links, I worked on the team implementation and updating the github issues. The code portion mainly included resolving the link issues that were coming from the dashboard of the home page. I was also able to create a nee spreadsheet for the group to keep the tasks organized between the group members on Google Sheets. Since I decided I was backend with the team, this week was a lot of research with Django and new API Implematations just to see what we were working with in regards to that section of the website. Also helped frontend with some formatting issues.

## 2. Project Retrospective


### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts:
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Jessica for figuring out my GitHub problem. I also appreciate Aaron for working on the IPA and the server.

   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   Chase's Thoughts: 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:  I appreciate Aaron for helping out with the API Issues and Elizabeth and Ceanna for helping me on the deliverable portion. 
   
   Jennie's Thoughts:

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We were able to get the code this week onto the website. I can see our idea coming to life. We are working as a team, and communicating everything that we talk about. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts:

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: This week, even though it was very research heavy, being able to understand more about backend implementation was great to be able to get a kickstart out of the website.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts:


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts:
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I was working in git bash, and my username was my full name for the longest time. GitHub did not see that it was me for the longest time. Now I figured out how to move about GitHub better now. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I was absent for a meeting which felt like I slacked for a bit but was able to pick up the pace the following days.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 

### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   Ceanna's Thoughts: So when we code only one person can work on the front end of the website at a time so that we do not mess up other people's code. We are waiting for people to finish the code.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts:
   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There is a learning curve when trying to figure out javascript, django and any other software that I was unfamiliar with.
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 

   
### **What should we try next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: When are talking about code, and how to split it up into groups. I feel that we should time it out for a couple of more days. So that we are not so overwhelmed for the next week to come.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think next time, discussing the issues I was having with learning backend features to get help would have been ideal.

   Jennie's Thoughts:
