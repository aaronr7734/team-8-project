## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I worked on the front-end side of the website and created a sketch of how the website would look like. For the deliverable, I worked on the Introduction section and the adopted technologies section where I talked about what frameworks/languages we’re going to use. A couple of things that I am having trouble with are my commits, and how my name in GitHub is my full name and not my user name. At  Tuesday’s meeting, Jess helped me figure out my GitHub so that it could work properly. During the meeting, we finally decided to use Bootstrap for the framework after some careful consideration. As soon as it was confirmed that we were using BootStrap, I downloaded the rest of the necessary framework in the meeting. After we had our discussion about frameworks sorted out, we talked about the design of the home page and voted on what design would suit the concept of college discounts. Once we found out how we wanted the home page to look as a whole, me and the rest of the frontend team broke up the homepage into sections to work on. I was in charge of the header, in which I added the Nau logo, the name, and two buttons on the right for the signup and login. As I started to incorporate BootStrap into my code, I found out that I need to have certain links that need to be in the code in order for it to work.

### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts:
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I was working in git bash, and my username was my full name for the longest time. GitHub did not see that it was me for the longest time. Now I figured out how to move about GitHub better now.

### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   Ceanna's Thoughts: So when we code only one person can work on the front end of the website at a time so that we do not mess up other people's code. We are waiting for people to finish the code.

   Jennie's Thoughts: 

   
### **What should we try next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: When are talking about code, and how to split it up into groups. I feel that we should time it out for a couple of more days. So that we are not so overwhelmed for the next week to come.
