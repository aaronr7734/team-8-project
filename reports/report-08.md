## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**:
For this week, I worked on the home page of the website incorporating the agreed sketch into my code. I created a filter button that filters based on major for right now, a search bar that is next to the filter button and a 'can't find what you need?' button. While I was in the process of implementing code for the section of the website, I worked on the README.md file that also needed the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file and the CONTRIBUTING.md file. After I created those three files according to the templates that were provided, I also worked on the Implementation Requirements section, in which I came up with 3 implementations that the requirements and associated pull request that we implemented for this release. At Tuesday's meeting, I made sure to download BootStrap once we knew that's a framework we wanted to use and I made sure that my local machine was up to date with GitHub and the new frameworks. At Thursday's meeting, we talked about what each member needed to do for the deliverable, report, and the home page. 

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I worked on the front-end side of the website and created a sketch of how the website would look like. For the deliverable, I worked on the Introduction section and the adopted technologies section where I talked about what frameworks/languages we’re going to use. A couple of things that I am having trouble with are my commits, and how my name in GitHub is my full name and not my user name. At  Tuesday’s meeting, Jess helped me figure out my GitHub so that it could work properly. During the meeting, we finally decided to use Bootstrap for the framework after some careful consideration. As soon as it was confirmed that we were using BootStrap, I downloaded the rest of the necessary framework in the meeting. After we had our discussion about frameworks sorted out, we talked about the design of the home page and voted on what design would suit the concept of college discounts. Once we found out how we wanted the home page to look as a whole, me and the rest of the frontend team broke up the homepage into sections to work on. I was in charge of the header, in which I added the Nau logo, the name, and two buttons on the right for the signup and login. As I started to incorporate BootStrap into my code, I found out that I need to have certain links that need to be in the code in order for it to work. 


### **Jessica**:
This week after adding functionality to the links, I worked on the team implementation and updating the github issues. The code portion mainly included resolving the link issues that were coming from the dashboard of the home page. I was also able to create a nee spreadsheet for the group to keep the tasks organized between the group members on Google Sheets. Since I decided I was backend with the team, this week was a lot of research with Django and new API Implematations just to see what we were working with in regards to that section of the website. Also helped frontend with some formatting issues.

### **Chase**:
This week I made a lot of progress on both the webstie and the deliverable. I was responsible for the look and feel, and license sections of the deliverable. I also helped Ceanna with the adopted technology section. I needed to research licenses and eventually pitched the MIT license as I thought it was the best fit. I also made sure the UI for the project was functional so I could complete the look and feel section. Albeit, we could not style all the pages to our liking. As for the website, I was responsible for creating the sign up, login, and category pages. I was also tasked with making sure each page was functional and linked properly to the homepage. Once linked, I made sure the login and sign up pages properly utilized user data to accomplish their specific objectives. On top of this, I was present for both the Tuesday and Thursday meetings and helped our team assign deadlines and plan future goals. I believe we got a lot done this week and am proud of the quality and quantity of the work that was done.

## 2. Project Retrospective


### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Jennie for keeping the team on track and making sure that the website format reflects what we talked about. 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Jessica for figuring out my GitHub problem. I also appreciate Aaron for working on the API and the server.

   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna for her help on the deliverable as well as Aaron for putting a lot of work into the Django side of our project.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:  I appreciate Aaron for helping out with the API Issues and Elizabeth and Ceanna for helping me on the deliverable portion. 
   
   Jennie's Thoughts:

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: This week, we are able to start coding and finally get started on what we wanted the website to look like and do.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We were able to get the code this week onto the website. I can see our idea coming to life. We are working as a team, and communicating everything that we talk about. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: We were able to make a lot of progress in a short amount of time. Our website came together fast and we are all working together to build it piece by piece.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: This week, even though it was very research heavy, being able to understand more about backend implementation was great to be able to get a kickstart out of the website.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts:


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Following our meeting on Thursday, I found that our communication was lacking, which caused some confusion. We had to redo certain parts of the code, and it appeared that we didn't stick to the initial plan or design. I'm hopeful that in the future, we can improve our team communication and collaborate more effectively to avoid making decisions that weren't previously agreed upon.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I was working in git bash, and my username was my full name for the longest time. GitHub did not see that it was me for the longest time. Now I figured out how to move about GitHub better now. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
   The last few days before the due date were hectic as we had too much to do and needed to catchup a little bit. I do not think we managed our time well enough this week and so we ended up almost biting off more than we could chew. 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I was absent for a meeting which felt like I slacked for a bit but was able to pick up the pace the following days.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 

### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: We were not on the same page about code and it was hard to tell who was doing what on the frontend side. The collaboration with backend was also kind of rough. 

   Ceanna's Thoughts: So when we code only one person can work on the front end of the website at a time so that we do not mess up other people's code. We are waiting for people to finish the code.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts:
   
   Chase's Thoughts: Due to the time crunch, we had all members of our group pushing and pulling the github at the same time. With everyone so busy, having to constantly check, approve, and make pull requests was a nuisance.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There is a learning curve when trying to figure out javascript, django and any other software that I was unfamiliar with.
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 

   
### **What should we try next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Next time, we should be more clear on who is doing what and we should keep to our word. 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: When are talking about code, and how to split it up into groups. I feel that we should time it out for a couple of more days. So that we are not so overwhelmed for the next week to come.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   
   Chase's Thoughts: We should definitely come up with a game plan and act on that plan sooner. I think it would be best to avoid scrambling to get everything done in time.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think next time, discussing the issues I was having with learning backend features to get help would have been ideal.

   Jennie's Thoughts:
