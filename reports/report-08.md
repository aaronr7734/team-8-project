## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**:
For this week, I worked on the home page of the website incorporating the agreed sketch into my code. I created a filter button that filters based on major for right now, a search bar that is next to the filter button, and a 'can't find what you need?' button. While I was in the process of implementing code for the section of the website, I worked on the README.md file that also needed the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file and the CONTRIBUTING.md file. After I created those three files according to the templates that were provided, I also worked on the Implementation Requirements section, in which I came up with 3 implementations that the requirements and associated pull requests that we implemented for this release. At Tuesday's meeting, I made sure to download BootStrap once we knew that it was a framework we wanted to use and I made sure that my local machine was up to date with GitHub and the new frameworks. At Thursday's meeting, we talked about what each member needed to do for the deliverable, report, and home page. 

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I worked on the front-end side of the website and created a sketch of how the website would look like. For the deliverable, I worked on the Introduction section and the adopted technologies section where I talked about what frameworks/languages we’re going to use. A couple of things that I am having trouble with are my commits, and how my name in GitHub is my full name and not my user name. At  Tuesday’s meeting, Jess helped me figure out my GitHub so that it could work properly. During the meeting, we finally decided to use Bootstrap for the framework after some careful consideration. As soon as it was confirmed that we were using BootStrap, I downloaded the rest of the necessary framework in the meeting. After we had our discussion about frameworks sorted out, we talked about the design of the home page and voted on what design would suit the concept of college discounts. Once we found out how we wanted the home page to look as a whole, I and the rest of the frontend team broke up the homepage into sections to work on. I was in charge of the header, in which I added the Nau logo, the name, and two buttons on the right for the signup and login. As I started to incorporate BootStrap into my code, I found out that I needed to have certain links that needed to be in the code in order for it to work. 


### **Jessica**:
This week after adding functionality to the links, I worked on the team implementation and updating the GitHub issues. The code portion mainly included resolving the link issues that were coming from the dashboard of the home page. I was also able to create a new spreadsheet for the group to keep the tasks organized between the group members on Google Sheets. Since I decided I was backend with the team, this week was a lot of research with Django and new API implementations just to see what we were working with in regards to that section of the website. Also helped the front end with some formatting issues.

### **Chase**:
This week I made a lot of progress on both the website and the deliverable. I was responsible for the look and feel, and license sections of the deliverable. I also helped Ceanna with the adopted technology section. I needed to research licenses and eventually pitched the MIT license as I thought it was the best fit. I also made sure the UI for the project was functional so I could complete the look and feel section. Albeit, we could not style all the pages to our liking. As for the website, I was responsible for creating the sign-up, login, and category pages. I was also tasked with making sure each page was functional and linked properly to the homepage. Once linked, I made sure the login and sign-up pages properly utilized user data to accomplish their specific objectives. On top of this, I was present for both the Tuesday and Thursday meetings and helped our team assign deadlines and plan future goals. I believe we got a lot done this week and am proud of the quality and quantity of the work that was done.

### **Jennie**:
This week, I worked on the home page of the website and did the front-end side. At the beginning of the week, the front-end team was tasked with creating their own sketch of what the home screen should look like I provided my own sketch and input on other sketches so we would come up with one conclusion on how it should look. This led to working on the home page, where I resized our discount boxes so they fit on the left side of the website. Doing that, allowed me to create the hot deals boxes, where we will soon be able to see the popular deals that are currently happening. Outside of coding for the website, I adjusted our team spreadsheet where team members will now record their activities so the team can have a better understanding of what other members including themselves are tasked to do. Lastly, I communicated with the team about how we wanted to do the deliverable this week and I obtained a better understanding of how GitHub works.


## 2. Project Retrospective
This week, we had the main focus on coding for our website. We started the week strong, where we had our Tuesday meeting and discussed the sketches that the front-end team created about the home screen. Everyone was able to provide at least one feature they liked and did not like about the sketch to get a better idea of what everyone wanted for the home screen. As the meeting progressed, we spoke about the deliverable further, about what everyone's roles and teams are based on what was already assigned. Since we did have to make adjustments over time with our deadline and roles which was fine. After Tuesday's meeting, the team was left with coding and doing their role for the deliverable, it was a difficult week for us since we had good communication at the start of the week but became more difficult towards the end since coding was more of a road block than we thought. Overall, we still managed to come back together as a team to accomplish our assignments.

### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Jennie for keeping the team on track and making sure that the website format reflects what we talked about. 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Jessica for figuring out my GitHub problem. I also appreciate Aaron for working on the API and the server.

   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna for her help on the deliverable as well as Aaron for putting a lot of work into the Django side of our project.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:  I appreciate Aaron for helping out with the API Issues and Elizabeth and Ceanna for helping me with the deliverable portion. 
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I appreciate Aaron for working on the API Issues and Jessica for working in duos this week for the deliverable.

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: This week, we are able to start coding and finally get started on what we wanted the website to look like and do.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We were able to get the code this week onto the website. I can see our idea coming to life. We are working as a team, and communicating everything that we talk about. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: We were able to make a lot of progress in a short amount of time. Our website came together fast and we are all working together to build it piece by piece.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: This week, even though it was very research-heavy, being able to understand more about backend implementation was great to be able to get a kickstart out of the website.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: This week, I thought our code itself was a success since we went from one simple template that Jessica created to forming a bigger picture and giving the website more life through functions and more.


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Following our meeting on Thursday, I found that our communication was lacking, which caused some confusion. We had to redo certain parts of the code, and it appeared that we didn't stick to the initial plan or design. I'm hopeful that in the future, we can improve our team communication and collaborate more effectively to avoid making decisions that weren't previously agreed upon.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I was working in git bash, and my username was my full name for the longest time. GitHub did not see that it was me for the longest time. Now I figured out how to move about GitHub better now. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
   The last few days before the due date were hectic as we had too much to do and needed to catch up a little bit. I do not think we managed our time well enough this week and so we ended up almost biting off more than we could chew. 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I was absent for a meeting which felt like I slacked for a bit but was able to pick up the pace the following days.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I thought our communication was our failure this week because it caused more problems than I realized since I knew the team needed to code but I had the difficulty of distributing code since I thought some parts were not done while other parts were. This week was taking a step back when it came to our communication since it was our first real week coding for the website.

### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: We were not on the same page about code and it was hard to tell who was doing what on the frontend side. The collaboration with the backend was also kind of rough. 

   Ceanna's Thoughts: So when we code only one person can work on the front end of the website at a time so that we do not mess up other people's code. We are waiting for people to finish the code.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts:
   
   Chase's Thoughts: Due to the time crunch, we had all members of our group pushing and pulling the GitHub at the same time. With everyone so busy, having to constantly check, approve, and make pull requests was a nuisance.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There is a learning curve when trying to figure out JavaScript, Django, and any other software that I am unfamiliar with.
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: Implementing code into our route seemed to be a barrier this week since we did not realize current aspects of the website were going to be as challenging as they were. Especially doing code through GitHub also seemed to be a barrier.

   
### **What should we try next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Next time, we should be more clear on who is doing what and we should keep to our word. 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: When are talking about code, and how to split it up into groups. I feel that we should time it out for a couple of more days. So that we are not so overwhelmed for the next week to come.
   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   
   Chase's Thoughts: We should definitely come up with a game plan and act on that plan sooner. I think it would be best to avoid scrambling to get everything done in time.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think next time, discussing the issues I was having with learning backend features to get help would have been ideal.

   Jennie's Thoughts: I think we should try next time to stick to our deadlines and to make sure everyone has an understanding of their part for the week. 
   
   
## 3. Next Steps
Now that we finally have a website, we need to code further for it as our next step. The website is still a bit of a skeleton where we have our important links working but they are not the prettiest right now. In addition, we need to adjust our coding style, where we need to be on the same page since we did have some members do some files one way while another person is doing it another way. So we need to come together as our next step to get a better understanding of how to manage our code as a team. Additionally, the team spreadsheet is now fully done which means, looking ahead, it needs to be used more so everyone has an understanding about what is going on. Lastly, the last few weeks have been better but this week was a road bump, so going forward, we need to reconnect again about how we want to manage our website and communicate with each other.
