### **Chase**:

### **Jennie**: 
At the beginning of the week, I was able to finish up my parts for the deliverable and write up the report. Following that, I was able to help Elizabeth with pushing code in GitHub since she built around the original HTML instead of using it so I assisted her in making it one HTML file for the home page and called it homepage.html. Then, I also coded to get the home screen to look how we wanted based on the sketch we agreed on last week. I did so by making the category section smaller and then adding another box to form the hot deals section. Lastly, Ceanna and I started working on the UML diagram for the next deliverable. 


## 2. Project Retrospective
At the beginning of this week, we finished up the deliverable as a team and were able to complete it and turn it in on time. As for the deliverable, it did not go according to plan as for the deadlines but everyone did an awesome job on doing their part for it. We did not have our normal Tuesday meeting, and since it was Halloween to make up for it we started to discuss the next deliverable. Then we followed up the conversion on our Thursday meeting and started to assign tasks. This will make it easier to go into the next two weeks before our next deliverable is due, we are going to take advantage of working in pairs again since we did do it last week and it worked out well. Overall, we had a great team effort on this last deliverable and will start planning out for our next one.

## 3. Next Steps
Going into this next week, our main focus is to work on the deliverable and still work on the website. By doing so, we are going to keep discussing what needs to be done for our next deliverable and continue to work on the website throughout this week. Since we need to improve on working on the website while managing other tasks like the deliverable, just so we can maintain a better habit of it. Speaking of habits, we are also trying to form the habit of using Google Sheets to record the activities happening throughout this project so that everyone is aware of what is happening and still communicating with one another. As for the code itself, we want to add more pseudo-code going forward so that other team members can understand if they were to look at it. So, as we go into this next week we are going to collaborate with one another and still make progress on our website.
