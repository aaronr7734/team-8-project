## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:
This week, much of my effort has been put into Documentation. I've been looking into different automated documentation tools like Sphinx.  These tools look promising, but I'm not sure if they'll generate documentation suitable for my team's abilities, especially considering that my docstrings might be difficult for my front-end team to read through. 
I'm also exploring the idea of writing documentation myself, but I'm not much of a writer, so I'm not sure I'll manage any better.
Unfortunately, since this Deliverable's more visual in nature, I've been limited in how I can assist my team. I've helped them walk through the structure of the project and am leaving the actual drawing to them.

### **Elizabeth**:

### **Ceanna**:
For this week, I wrote notes for the weekly meeting. I made sure each of us knew exactly what we needed to do for the next dielivable. I added each task in the spreadsheet for the deliverable and the report. We are on track for this week and for next week. For coding I worked on fixing the header of the homepage. I went back in, and tried to make it look exactly like the sketch that the frontend team created. Another thing that I did this week was research, I want to make sure that we know what we are doing in javascript. I have been researching bootstrap at the same time. Also I am working with Jennie on one of the UML diagram for the next deliverables.

### **Jessica**:

### **Chase**:

### **Jennie**: 
At the beginning of the week, I was able to finish up my parts for the deliverable and write up the report. Following that, I was able to help Elizabeth with pushing code in GitHub since she built around the original HTML instead of using it so I assisted her in making it one HTML file for the home page and called it homepage.html. Then, I also coded to get the home screen to look how we wanted based on the sketch we agreed on last week. I did so by making the category section smaller and then adding another box to form the hot deals section. Lastly, Ceanna and I started working on the UML diagram for the next deliverable. 


## 2. Project Retrospective
At the beginning of this week, we finished up the deliverable as a team and were able to complete it and turn it in on time. As for the deliverable, it did not go according to plan as for the deadlines but everyone did an awesome job on doing their part for it. We did not have our normal Tuesday meeting, and since it was Halloween to make up for it we started to discuss the next deliverable. Then we followed up the conversion on our Thursday meeting and started to assign tasks. This will make it easier to go into the next two weeks before our next deliverable is due, we are going to take advantage of working in pairs again since we did do it last week and it worked out well. Overall, we had a great team effort on this last deliverable and will start planning out for our next one.


### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: My appreciates for this week is to Jessica for leading thursday meeting, and make sure that we know what we are going for the deliverable.


   Aaron's Thoughts: Appreciate Jessica for working through the class diagram with me.

   Chase's Thoughts: 
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:  
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: My appreciation this week goes to Jessica and Aaron for being able to conduct the testing on the deliverable and work on the backend of the website.

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We got the deliverable finished, and we have a plan for the next deliverable to go more smoothly.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: Our team meeting this week was really productive.

   
   Chase's Thoughts:

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: For this week, I felt like we were successful in completing the deliverable and working on the website. I also thought it was a success to work through GitHub for the website when it came to coding.  


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We did not get a lot of code done, it was a lot of research that we need to do for this week. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: I think a good chunk of the group still doesn't understand the point of the API, which is on me.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
  
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: For this week, the deliverable was a bit of a mess due to timeline constraints we had some ideas of deadlines but other classes got the best of us.

   
### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We are getting a lot of research done, and but we keep researching the wrong thing. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: I still think more time needs to be taken for research / learning the tools we're using.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
  
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: The main barrier this week, I found to be is working with the frameworks since we are still learning them and adjusting to them as we progress with the website.

  
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think next week we need to make sure that we are researching and coding at the same time, so that we fall back on code.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: Nothing I haven't said already. More time needs to be taken to understand the tools we're working with. Time is being wasted because we don't know how to use these tools optimally.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: 
  
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think maintaining our deadlines would help next time because we knew what we needed to do, it was more about managing the time to do it. Especially since some parts took longer than expected.
   
   
## 3. Next Steps
Going into this next week, our main focus is to work on the deliverable and still work on the website. By doing so, we are going to keep discussing what needs to be done for our next deliverable and continue to work on the website throughout this week. Since we need to improve on working on the website while managing other tasks like the deliverable, just so we can maintain a better habit of it. Speaking of habits, we are also trying to form the habit of using Google Sheets to record the activities happening throughout this project so that everyone is aware of what is happening and still communicating with one another. As for the code itself, we want to add more pseudo-code going forward so that other team members can understand if they were to look at it. So, as we go into this next week we are going to collaborate with one another and still make progress on our website.
