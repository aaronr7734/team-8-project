## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:
This week, much of my effort has been put into Documentation. I've been looking into different automated documentation tools like Sphinx.  These tools look promising, but I'm not sure if they'll generate documentation suitable for my team's abilities, especially considering that my docstrings might be difficult for my front-end team to read through. 
I'm also exploring the idea of writing documentation myself, but I'm not much of a writer, so I'm not sure I'll manage it any better.
Unfortunately, since this deliverable is more visual, I've been limited in how I can assist my team. I've helped them walk through the project's structure and am leaving the actual drawing to them.

### **Elizabeth**: 

For this week, a lot of my attention went to fixing up the code and preparing for the next deliverable. I am still in the process of making the home page more pretty to look at while still keeping to the agreed design. Since a lot of the code was messy and out of order, I decided to clean the HTML up as well. In preparation for the deliverable next week, I researched more into how Bootstrap and Django work and I found that Bootstrap is way more efficient when it came down to cleaning up our design. I am also planning on working with Chase on the sequence diagram for the deliverable, in which I am editing the diagram up to the deliverable requirements. In order to keep everyone up to date on what I'm doing, I also edited the spreadsheet to reflect what I'm doing currently. 

### **Ceanna**:
For this week, I wrote notes for the weekly meeting. I made sure each of us knew exactly what we needed to do for the next deliverable. I added each task in the spreadsheet for the deliverable and the report. We are on track for this week and next week. For coding, I worked on fixing the header of the homepage. I went back in and tried to make it look exactly like the sketch that the front-end team created. Another thing that I did this week was research, I want to make sure that we know what we are doing in JavaScript. I have been researching Bootstrap at the same time. Also, I am working with Jennie on one of the UML diagram for the next deliverable.

### **Jessica**:
This week was mainly setting up the research I needed to start the team on the next deliverable. We were able to set up the roles for the deliverable. I was also researching c/c++ implementations for the website and more on Django because I wanted to get ahead with Aaron on the server side of the website. I am also looking into more class diagrams so I can able to fill my role in the Deliverable but we were able to finish the architecture diagrams.

### **Chase**:
This week was a little more relaxed than the last but still rather productive. We started by discussing the next deliverable at Tuesday's meeting, in which we all began working on the diagrams; namely the architecture diagram. On top of this, I helped plan the further progression of backend development and the progression on the project as a whole. I worked with Elizabeth on the sequence diagram for the deliverable. The process went smoothly and was completed in a timely manner. I furthered my research and testing with Django so that I may continue to get a better understanding of the framework to contribute to the project. My understanding of Django has increased exponentially and thus I predict further backend development will continue steadily.

### **Jennie**: 
At the beginning of the week, I was able to finish up my parts for the deliverable and write up the report. Following that, I was able to help Elizabeth with pushing code in GitHub since she built around the original HTML instead of using it so I assisted her in making it one HTML file for the home page and called it homepage.html. Then, I also coded to get the home screen to look how we wanted based on the sketch we agreed on last week. I did so by making the category section smaller and adding another box to form the hot deals section. Lastly, Ceanna and I started working on the UML diagram for the next deliverable. 


## 2. Project Retrospective
At the beginning of this week, we finished up the deliverable as a team and were able to complete it and turn it in on time. As for the deliverable, it did not go according to plan as for the deadlines but everyone did an awesome job on doing their part for it. We did not have our normal Tuesday meeting, and since it was Halloween to make up for it we started to discuss the next deliverable. Then we followed up the conversion on our Thursday meeting and started to assign tasks. This will make it easier to go into the next two weeks before our next deliverable is due, we are going to take advantage of working in pairs again since we did do it last week and it worked out well. Overall, we had a great team effort on this last deliverable and will start planning out for our next one.


### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Jennie for doing her hardest to keep up with the team and providing input for code. 
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: My appreciation for this week is to Jessica for leading Thursday's meeting, and making sure that we know what we are going for the deliverable.


   Aaron's Thoughts: Appreciate Jessica for working through the class diagram with me.

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for helping me with the sequence diagram and Aaron for providing me with helping Django links.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate Aaron for being a great help with describing what each diagram should entail
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: My appreciation this week goes to Jessica and Aaron for being able to conduct the testing on the deliverable and work on the backend of the website.

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: We made good progress on the next deliverable and the meeting was very productive.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We got the deliverable finished, and we have a plan for the next deliverable to go more smoothly.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: Our team meeting this week was really productive.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: We have already made a lot of progress on the next deliverable.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think this week was great in splitting up what everyone should tackle

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: For this week, I felt like we were successful in completing the deliverable and working on the website. I also thought it was a success to work through GitHub for the website when it came to coding.  


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: There wasn't a lot of coding for the website this week due to other responsibilities.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We did not get a lot of code done, it was a lot of research that we needed to do for this week. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: I think a good chunk of the group still doesn't understand the point of the API, which is on me.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: The focus of this week was mainly on the next deliverable rather than the website itself, so we did not get as much code done as we would have liked.
  
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think we split up the work in an inefficient manner and need to see what each part is so no one gets more work than others.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: For this week, the deliverable was a bit of a mess due to timeline constraints we had some ideas of deadlines but other classes got the best of us.

   
### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Though we finally decided on frameworks, it's taking a while to get used to them and implement them in our code.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We are getting a lot of research done, and but we keep researching the wrong thing. 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: I still think more time needs to be taken for research / learning the tools we're using.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think we need to work on catching up in terms of understanding the frameworks / tools that we are using.
  
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There is a big split with understanding different topics that is taking some toll on group members 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: The main barrier this week, I found to be is working with the frameworks since we are still learning them and adjusting to them as we progress with the website.

  
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think we should decide on more suitable deadlines and maybe assign a meeting or two on figuring out how these frameworks work while working on coding the website more thoroughly.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think next week we need to make sure that we are researching and coding at the same time, so that we fall back on code.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: Nothing I haven't said already. More time needs to be taken to understand the tools we're working with. Time is being wasted because we don't know how to use these tools optimally.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: We need to balance code and deliverables better. I think it would help if we were all caught up in our research.
  
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Understanding what roles need to do what would help us get a lot more done.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think maintaining our deadlines would help next time because we knew what we needed to do, it was more about managing the time to do it. Especially since some parts took longer than expected.
   
   
## 3. Next Steps
Going into this next week, our main focus is to work on the deliverable and still work on the website. By doing so, we are going to keep discussing what needs to be done for our next deliverable and continue to work on the website throughout this week. Since we need to improve on working on the website while managing other tasks like the deliverable, just so we can maintain a better habit of it. Speaking of habits, we are also trying to form the habit of using Google Sheets to record the activities happening throughout this project so that everyone is aware of what is happening and still communicating with one another. As for the code itself, we want to add more pseudo-code going forward so that other team members can understand if they were to look at it. So, as we go into this next week we are going to collaborate with one another and still make progress on our website.
