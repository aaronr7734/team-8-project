## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**:


### **Ceanna**:


### **Jessica**:


### **Chase**:

This week I primarily focused on the midterm presention and getting started with the code for the project. I also helped write the report, plan our next meeting, and began work on the next deliverable. On top of this, I wrote slides for the presentation and worked with elizabeth to present the functional requirements and diagram slides. As for coding for the next deliverable, We decided to start by adding backend code to the front page. I installed and began working with our final backend framework (django), and began coding functional links to other pages to the site.

### **Jennie**:

This week I had the main focus working on the midterm presentation where I worked on the Value Proposition Statement slide. Then, attended our first weekly meeting of the week on Tuesday to discuss how the presentation should go and made sure to keep everyone on track throughout the meeting. This also led to the decision to split up the diagram slides into duos, where Ceanna and I spoke about the UML Class Diagram and Chase and Elizabeth spoke about the UML Case Diagram. Now, I have the main focus of getting ahead of the next deliverable by assigning everyone's roles for the week and what we need to accomplish as a team. I, as a front-end, have been assigned to create designs for the home pages since we basically have a skeleton right now and need to improve the way it looks and the way it functions.

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think this week had more successes than failures. However, we did struggle to get the presentation together. That being said, we pulled it off!

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I believe the only failure we had this week was knowing how to start the presentation. Since we knew what we wanted to do throughout the presentation but had a rocky start.


### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Chase's Thoughts: I believe adapting to the frameworks and backend coding of the project will be a little difficult.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: A real barrier for this week is just maintaining our timeline since everything has been assigned but I need to make sure we are able to work with that. 

   
### **What should we do next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 

   
   Aaron's Thoughts:

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think it would be best if we checked everyone's code progress and planned the next meeting around that.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think that we could have done more rehearsal time just to have less jitters when it came to our presentation.
   
   
## 3. Next Steps

Now that the midterm presentation is over, we are able to fully dive into coding this week. blah blah i have to resume this later
