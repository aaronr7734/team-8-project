## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

This week, I created and presented the problem statement slide for our team's presentation. I also conducted research on development frameworks to aid in our final decision-making. On the studentsdiscountz.org server, I set up user accounts for all team members and implemented a solution to provide them access to the Django virtual environment I had previously established. Lastly, I spent time building a practice Django project, following web-based tutorials to understand models and the REST framework.

### **Elizabeth**:

For this week, I mainly focused on the midterm presentation in which I created a UML Use Case Diagram reflecting our project so far and helped interpret it for the class with Chase. I also attended Thursday's meeting in which I participated in discussing our previous deliverable and how we are going to split up the sections and complete the next one according to the requirements. I started to work on the next deliverable according to what was assigned to me and looked at the rest of the deliverable to make sure I understood what this deliverable needed. Since I have been recently assigned as a front-end developer for our project, I completed a home screen sketch to get a better idea of what design would best intertwine with its functionalities. I also edited the README file on our GitHub to better reflect our project currently and better format it.

### **Ceanna**:

For this week, I worked on the UML Class Diagram slide, where we made sure to receive feedback before our presentation. Once we got this feedback, it was my job to fix the lines and add the associations for each class. My goal was to make sure that the diagram was ready for the midterm presentation. On presentation day, I spoke about the UML Class Diagram but just on the admin side since Jennie and I split up the diagram to make it easier on both of us. After the presentation was our final weekly meeting on Thursday where I was in charge of taking notes this week. My job was to make sure that the notes were detailed for the group based on the discussion throughout the meeting. This led me to create a homework document that reflected the deadlines that Jennie had set for the week so that she could also finalize the dates. Unfortunately, we are still not sure what framework we want to use, so I decided to further my own research about what frameworks we could use which led me to the conclusion that we should use Bootstrap for the front-end and Django for the back-end.

### **Jessica**:
This week I downloaded React and updated the main page template. This week we were also all able to finish the midterm presentation. I was in charge of the user story slide and I went ahead and finalized that. We decided our roles for the code this week so the Backend team and I were trying to figure out what needed to be done with the frontend of the team. I also went ahead and created the code folder on GitHub so we can get the code portion started for the project.


### **Chase**:

This week I primarily focused on the midterm presentation and getting started with the code for the project. I also helped write the report, plan our next meeting, and begin work on the next deliverable. On top of this, I wrote slides for the presentation and worked with Elizabeth to present the functional requirements and diagram slides. As for coding for the next deliverable, We decided to start by adding backend code to the front page. I installed and began working with our final backend framework (Django), and began coding functional links to other pages to the site.

### **Jennie**:

This week I had the main focus working on the midterm presentation where I worked on the Value Proposition Statement slide. Then, attended our first weekly meeting of the week on Tuesday to discuss how the presentation should go and made sure to keep everyone on track throughout the meeting. This also led to the decision to split up the diagram slides into duos, where Ceanna and I spoke about the UML Class Diagram and Chase and Elizabeth spoke about the UML Case Diagram. Now, I have the main focus of getting ahead of the next deliverable by assigning everyone's roles for the week and what we need to accomplish as a team. I, as a front-end, have been assigned to create designs for the home pages since we basically have a skeleton right now and need to improve the way it looks and the way it functions. 


## 2. Project Retrospective

This week had the main focus on working on the midterm presentation and starting the conversation about deliverable 4. When it came to the midterm presentation, Ceanna not only created the slide document but assigned everyone their own slides. The slides that were assigned were Aaron with the Problem Statement, Jennie with the Value Proposition Statement, Jessica with the User Stories, Chase with the Functional Requirements, and Elizabeth with the UML Use Case Diagram where she received assistance from Chase on the presentation side of it. A similar situation with Ceanna, where she did the UML Class Diagram and received assistance from Jennie on the presentation side since it was a lot of information to speak about at once. Overall, it was a great team effort, and the presentation ran so smoothly. After the presentation, we had our final weekly meeting of the week on Thursday where we reflected on our presentation and spoke about how this upcoming week is going to go. We already have a skeleton for our home screen so the front-end is going to make adjustments on appearance and the back-end is going to be working on the functionalities. 

### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Chase for his help on the diagram and for actively participating in last week's meeting.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth creating the Class User Case diagram. It came out perfect.

   Aaron's Thoughts: Appreciate Ceanna for creating and organizing this week's agenda.

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna for doing a lot of heaving lifting on the agenda and I also appreciate Jessica for designing our home page.
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate Chase for being able to discuss the backend plans and also appreciate Jennie for being an organized manager. 
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna and Elizabeth for creating and adjusting the diagrams for this week's presentation.


### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: The presentation was a huge success all around and the next deliverable is coming along nicely. 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We succeeded in coming together as a team. I feel that we have a good plan for the next week.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: We did a pretty good job on the presentation! Communication is improving and we're finally getting a handle on things.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think everyone did great on the presentation and believe that we are making good progress in terms of the next deliverable.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think this week everyone did great on the presentation and finished everything on time. 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We had a great presentation and accomplished the goal of maintaining the time and not going over or under on it.


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: The beginning of the presentation was a moment that we were all unprepared for, but we made up for it as we continued the presentation. Overall, there were not many failures this week.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Make sure that we follow through with the deadlines that create for our own use.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: We're not completely decided on frameworks. We should have come to these decisions a week ago so we could've had the full two-week period to work on our MVP.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think this week had more successes than failures. However, we did struggle to get the presentation together. That being said, we pulled it off!

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: During the presentation I stuttered on my last bullet point because of my lack of practice.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I believe the only failure we had this week was knowing how to start the presentation. We knew what we wanted to do throughout the presentation but had a rocky start.


### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: A barrier this week happened to be that we're taking a little longer than usual to start coding.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think that the barrier that we might have will be what we code next week. We need to make sure that we know exactly what each of us decides to code.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: We have so much to learn and not much time to learn it.
   
   
   Chase's Thoughts: I believe adapting to the frameworks and backend coding of the project will be a little difficult.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Trying to just start the project seems like a big barrier to start with because there seems to be so much going on.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: A real barrier for this week is just maintaining our timeline since everything has been assigned but I need to make sure we are able to work with that. 

   
### **What should we do next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think that we could share our code for the next meeting just so we can have a clear idea of the progress made.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think we should take to the backend and frontend groups before the meeting ends so that we can figure out a more concise plan.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: We need to spend a lot more time rehearsing next time we have a presentation.

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think it would be best if we checked everyone's code progress and planned the next meeting around that.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think I could have practiced the presentation a bit more to prevent the mess up I had

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think that we could have done more rehearsal time just to have less jitters when it came to our presentation.
   
   
## 3. Next Steps

Now that the midterm presentation is over, we are able to fully dive into coding this week. For starters, Jennie assigned deadlines for this week to make sure we, as a team, start coding this week and have something for our weekly Tuesday meeting. Going forward, we are finally deciding what framework to use since our original thought was to use Django and ReactJS. As of right now, we are definitely using Django but we also had the thought of using Bootstrap so our next step is to look further into that. Additionally, our next step for the website overall is to have our home page adjusted to where we fully like it and have the goal of getting some functions to work. We know that we are not going to accomplish all of our functions this week but we are starting them which is some progress. Lastly, we want to make sure to communicate fluently between the front-end (Jennie, Ceanna, and Elizabeth) and back-end (Aaron, Chase, and Jessica) to make sure we are on the same page and record the progress being made throughout this week and future weeks to come.
