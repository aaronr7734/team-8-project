### **Chase**

This week I primarily focused on the midterm presention and getting started with the code for the project. I also helped write the report, plan our next meeting, and began work on the next deliverable. On top of this, I wrote slides for the presentation and worked with elizabeth to present the functional requirements and diagram slides. As for coding for the next deliverable, We decided to start by adding backend code to the front page. I installed and began working with our final backend framework (django), and began coding functional links to other pages to the site.
