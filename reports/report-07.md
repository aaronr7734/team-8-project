## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**:

For this week, I mainly focused on the midterm presentation in which I created a UML Use Case Diagram reflecting our project so far and helped interpret
it for the class with Chase. I also attended Thursday's meeting in which I participated in discussing our previous deliverable and how we are going to split up the sections and complete the next one according to the requirements. I started to work on the next deliverable according to what was assigned to me and looked at the rest of the deliverable to make sure I understood what this deliverable needed. Since I have been recently assigned as a frontend developer for our project, I completed a home screen sketch to get a better idea of what design would best intertwine with it functionalities. I also edited the README file on our GitHub to better reflect our project currently and better format it.

### **Ceanna**:
For this week, I worked on the UML Class diagram. We got feedback before our presenatation. It was my job to fix the lines and add the association for each class. I made sure that the diagram was ready to present for the midterm presntation. I spoke about the admin side on the diagram for the presentation. The next meeting that we had, I was incharge of the notes. I made sure to take details notes for the group. I also created a homework document that I sent to Jennie to finalize the homework. It was a way for each of us to see what we need to do next. We are not sure of what framework we still what to use, so I did some research about frameworks. I conclued that we should use bootstap for front end and Django for back end.

### **Jessica**:
This week I downloaded react and updated the main page template. This week we were also all able to finish the midterm presentation. I was in charge of the user story slide and I went ahead and finilized that. We decided our roles for the code this week so the Backend team and I were trying to figure out what needed to be done with the frontend of the team. I also went ahead and created the code folder on the gitbub so we can get the code portion started for the project.


### **Chase**:

This week I primarily focused on the midterm presention and getting started with the code for the project. I also helped write the report, plan our next meeting, and began work on the next deliverable. On top of this, I wrote slides for the presentation and worked with elizabeth to present the functional requirements and diagram slides. As for coding for the next deliverable, We decided to start by adding backend code to the front page. I installed and began working with our final backend framework (django), and began coding functional links to other pages to the site.

### **Jennie**:

This week I had the main focus working on the midterm presentation where I worked on the Value Proposition Statement slide. Then, attended our first weekly meeting of the week on Tuesday to discuss how the presentation should go and made sure to keep everyone on track throughout the meeting. This also led to the decision to split up the diagram slides into duos, where Ceanna and I spoke about the UML Class Diagram and Chase and Elizabeth spoke about the UML Case Diagram. Now, I have the main focus of getting ahead of the next deliverable by assigning everyone's roles for the week and what we need to accomplish as a team. I, as a front-end, have been assigned to create designs for the home pages since we basically have a skeleton right now and need to improve the way it looks and the way it functions. 


## 2. Project Retrospective

This week 

### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Chase for his help on the diagram and actively participating in last week's meeting.
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth creating the Class User Case diagram. It came out perfect.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna for doing a lot of heaving lifting on the agenda and I also appreciate Jessica for designing our home page.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate Chase for being able to discuss the backend plans and also appreciate Jennie for being an organized manager. 
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna and Elizabeth for creating and adjusting the diagrams for this week's presentation.


### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: The presentation was a huge success all around and the next deliverable is coming along nicely. 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We successed coming together as a team. I feel that we have a good plan for the next week.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think everyone did great on the presentation and believe that we are making good progress in terms of the next deliverable.

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think this week everyone did great on the presentation and finishing everything on time. 

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We had a great presentation and accomplished the goal of maintaining the time and not going over or under on it.


### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: The beginning of the presentation was a moment where we were all unprepared for, but we made up for it as we continued the presentation. Overall, there were not many failures this week.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Making sure that we follow through with the deadlines that create for our own use.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think this week had more successes than failures. However, we did struggle to get the presentation together. That being said, we pulled it off!

   
   Jessica's Thoughts: During the presentation I stuttered on my last bullet point because of my lack of practice.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I believe the only failure we had this week was knowing how to start the presentation. Since we knew what we wanted to do throughout the presentation but had a rocky start.


### **Barriers**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: A barrier this week happened to be that we're taking a little longer than usual to start coding.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think that barrier that we might have will be what we code next week. We need to make sure that we know exacty what each of use decide to code.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Chase's Thoughts: I believe adapting to the frameworks and backend coding of the project will be a little difficult.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Trying to just start the project seems like a big barrier to start with because there seems to be so much going on.

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: A real barrier for this week is just maintaining our timeline since everything has been assigned but I need to make sure we are able to work with that. 

   
### **What should we do next time**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think that we could share our code for next meeting just so we can have a clear idea of the progress made.

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think we should take to the backend and frontend groups before the meeting ended, so that we can firgure out a more conise plan.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts:

   
   Chase's Thoughts: I think it would be best if we checked everyone's code progress and planned the next meeting around that.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think I could have practiced the presentation a bit more to prevent the mess up I had

   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think that we could have done more rehearsal time just to have less jitters when it came to our presentation.
   
   
## 3. Next Steps

Now that the midterm presentation is over, we are able to fully dive into coding this week. blah blah i have to resume this later
