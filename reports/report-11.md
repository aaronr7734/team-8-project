## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

### **Elizabeth**: 

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I took care of the notes for the meetings. We, as a group, talked about the deliverable and the report. We also discussed what we need to do for the website. Jessica and I worked together to hand out the jobs. For this, while working on the code, we as a group decided that the sign up page and the log in page need work. I went in and updated those two pages so that they are more connected to the other pages. Also this week, I helped Jessica with the javascript for the login and sign up pages. For the deliverable, I worked on the lessons learned part. I went into the details of what we learned as a group over the past couple of weeks.

### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts:  This week, there was a fault in our communication. We all had one idea but it would get lost in communication. I did make a spelling mistake that might have been contributing to the wrong time, but it was figured out.

### **Barriers**: 
  
  Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: There is not enough time to do everything we want to do for the website. Also, our knowledge of what we know is something that hurts us from what we want to do. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Next week, we should try and keep communicating as best as we can. If there is something that we are unsure about we need to ask right away before it gets lost in translation.
