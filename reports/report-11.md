## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

### **Elizabeth**: 
For this week, I mostly focused on the progress of the website where I took time to improve the homepage. I added a sticky navigation tab, a placeholder image for our logo and also put in stand-in discount cards for the hot deals section. I made sure to add the links to the sign in and login page to the navbar so that the user would be able to visibly see those options. I will continue to make improvements to the homepage throughout next week so that our page doesn't look too empty. I also worked on the deliverable as I was assigned the implemented requirements section. Having previous experience with this section, it wasn't too bad to do. 

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I took care of the notes for the meetings. We, as a group, talked about the deliverable and the report. We also discussed what we need to do for the website. Jessica and I worked together to hand out the jobs. For this, while working on the code, we as a group decided that the sign up page and the log in page need work. I went in and updated those two pages so that they are more connected to the other pages. Also this week, I helped Jessica with the javascript for the login and sign up pages. For the deliverable, I worked on the lessons learned part. I went into the details of what we learned as a group over the past couple of weeks.

### **Jessica**: 

### **Chase**:
This week I primarily focused on the deliverable. I was assigned to testing along with Aaron and so we wrote multiple tests for the multiple different classes and tested their functionality. This proved to be more difficult than I thought, as we ran into a few errors while testing and had trouble with the testing environment. This led to us not being able to fully test all aspects of the code. That being said, we were able to test the majority our code and iron out the bugs we found. I wrote the tests for notifications and categories and committed these changes to Aaron's branch so we could better collaborate. On top of this, I discussed our plans for the deliverable and the report with the entirety of the group as well as helped decide future backend endeavors. Overall I believe this was a productive yet challenging week.

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think we succeeded in splitting up the work accordingly.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts:  I think we succeeded in splitting up the work, and this allowed us to practice pair programming this week. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: We successfully managed to complete most of the deliverable on time.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: This week, we had trouble being on the same page with the coding aspect and it seems like the communication between frontend and backend isn't getting any better.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts:  This week, there was a fault in our communication. We all had one idea but it would get lost in communication. I did make a spelling mistake that might have been contributing to the wrong time, but it was figured out.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: Production got a little crammed this week and I was unsure if we were gonna be able to complete it in time.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Barriers**: 
  
  Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think time is our biggest barrier so far as there is so much that needs to be done but not a lot of time to do it.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: There is not enough time to do everything we want to do for the website. Also, our knowledge of what we know is something that hurts us from what we want to do. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I think time is our biggest barrier due to the fact that we are often cutting it close to deadlines and sometimes coming up short. Better time management would greatly benefit us.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think we should try to refresh ourselves on what we already talked about so that we don't talk about the same stuff twice.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Next week, we should try and keep communicating as best as we can. If there is something that we are unsure about we need to ask right away before it gets lost in translation. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I would like to personally manage my time better as to further increase productivity while avoiding having to rush.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts:
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts:
