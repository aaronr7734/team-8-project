## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

### **Elizabeth**: 
For this week, I mostly focused on the progress of the website where I took time to improve the homepage. I added a sticky navigation tab, a placeholder image for our logo, and also put in stand-in discount cards for the hot deals section. I made sure to add the links to the sign-in and login page to the navbar so that the user would be able to see those options. I will continue to make improvements to the homepage throughout next week so that our page doesn't look too empty. I also worked on the deliverable as I was assigned the implemented requirements section. Having previous experience with this section, it wasn't too bad to do. 

### **Ceanna**:
This week, I took care of the notes for the meetings. We, as a group, talked about the deliverable and the report. We also discussed what we need to do for the website. Jessica and I worked together to hand out the jobs. For this, while working on the code, we as a group decided that the signup page and the login page needed work. I went in and updated those two pages so that they are more connected to the other pages. Also this week, I helped Jessica with the javascript for the login and sign-up pages. For the deliverable, I worked on the lessons learned part. I went into the details of what we learned as a group over the past couple of weeks.

### **Jessica**: 
This week was heavily focused on the JavaScript implementations on the signup and login pages. There were some issues with connecting the API and the users which are still being figured out. I also figured out a way to implement the C aspect which would be password security using the throw and catch errors. The main issue would just be implementing all this into the website which is what I have been trying to figure out

### **Chase**:
This week I primarily focused on the deliverable. I was assigned to testing along with Aaron and so we wrote multiple tests for the multiple different classes and tested their functionality. This proved to be more difficult than I thought, as we ran into a few errors while testing and had trouble with the testing environment. This led to us not being able to fully test all aspects of the code. That being said, we were able to test the majority of our code and iron out the bugs we found. I wrote the tests for notifications and categories and committed these changes to Aaron's branch so we could better collaborate. On top of this, I discussed our plans for the deliverable and the report with the entirety of the group as well as helped decide future backend endeavors. Overall I believe this was a productive yet challenging week.

### **Jennie**: 
For this week, I mostly focused on the deliverable and the progress of the website. When it came to the deliverable, Elizabeth and I worked on the implemented requirement section together where we searched our GitHub and retrieved the issues we needed to piece our section of the deliverable together. When it came to the progress of the website, I completed the progress towards creating a home button for the login/signup pages so if the user wants to return to the home page from either screen they can. Lastly, I helped Elizabeth research how to create the navbar to use on the home page.

## 2. Project Retrospective
### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Jess for helping with the meetings.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts:  I appreciate Aaron and Chase for taking care of the testing of the website. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Aaron for all his help with the tests.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna for being able to reformat the website in a great way.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for taking care of the implemented requirements section with me.
   
### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think we succeeded in splitting up the work accordingly.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts:  I think we succeeded in splitting up the work, and this allowed us to practice pair programming this week. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: We successfully managed to complete most of the deliverable on time.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think we finally developed a great routine using GitHub with the reports and deliverables.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think we had a good discussion in our meetings.
   
### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: This week, we had trouble being on the same page with the coding aspect and it seems like the communication between frontend and backend isn't getting any better.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts:  This week, there was a fault in our communication. We all had one idea but it would get lost in communication. I did make a spelling mistake that might have been contributing to the wrong time, but it was figured out.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: Production got a little cramped this week and I was unsure if we were gonna be able to complete it in time.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Mix in skill issues, being unfamiliar with API made logging users into the database hard.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: This week, the attention towards the deliverable was not as productive as it could have been.
   
### **Barriers**: 
  
  Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think time is our biggest barrier so far as there is so much that needs to be done but not a lot of time to do it.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: There is not enough time to do everything we want to do for the website. Also, our knowledge of what we know is something that hurts us from what we want to do. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I think time is our biggest barrier because we are often cutting it close to deadlines and sometimes coming up short. Better time management would greatly benefit us.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: The website seems a little rushed, I feel as though more time was spent planning than coding which would normally be ideal in an actual project but we cut close with time.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: The biggest barrier so far is time management since we seemed rushed and not producing as well as we would like to.
   
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think we should try to refresh ourselves on what we already talked about so that we don't talk about the same stuff twice.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Next week, we should try and keep communicating as best as we can. If there is something that we are unsure about we need to ask right away before it gets lost in translation. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I would like to personally manage my time better to further increase productivity while avoiding having to rush.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I would like to have handled the backend portion better, I feel as though we came in short.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think we need a better way of recording what is going on so that there is not a mix-up in communication about activities in this project.
   
## 3. Next Steps
For our next steps, we are going to collect ourselves from this week's deliverable since this week we pushed ourselves to complete the deliverable on time. After we reflect the team's effort towards the deliverables and reports we can then maintain the discussion and talk about the website. By talking about the website we will try to achieve the goal of being on the same page from both sides, frontend and backend to be more understanding and construct better time management before our next deliverable and report. So, in this virtual meeting on Tuesday, we will discuss roles for the next deliverable and how we want to approach it and make more of a better effort for better deadlines since we have not been giving ourselves enough time as we should. Lastly, we shall continue building on the website to improve appearance and functionality for the weeks to come.
