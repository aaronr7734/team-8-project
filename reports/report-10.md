## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

This week, I contributed to several diagrams for our deliverable by talking through them with the rest of the team. Additionally, I wrote the `system description`` and `design principles`` sections.
I also spent a good chunk of time trying to learn Javascript so I could provide code examples for using our REST API, but that hasn't been going too well. Front-end development isn't something I've ever been good at. I've been revisiting automated documentation and intend to have something up by Sunday.

### **Elizabeth**: 


### **Ceanna**:


### **Jessica**: 
This week I focused on finishing the class diagram for the report that is due on Sunday. This required me to change our existing diagram from one that fits our code more better. I also began the researcg for the API and Django so I can start the code refactoring for next week. 


### **Chase**:
This week I was focused on getting my deliverable work done early. I decided I wanted to avoid last week's situation and get ahead on what I needed to do. I accomplished this by starting the sequence diagram early; completing the diagram itself in the beginning of the week. On top of this, I also helped design the architecture diagram and wrote the description for said architecture diagram. Once the deliverable work was done, I set out to continue working with django so that I will be better prepared for next week. I ran a few tests and found a few more online sources to further my understanding and thus prepare for the next deliverable.

### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: We got a huge chunk of Deliverable 5 done earlier than we typically do.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: We weren't pressed for time like we were this time last week. I believe this made things go a lot smoother.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: We finished all the diagrams earlier than I though which really helps with the deliverable times.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: Within a matter of a few weeks, it feels like our communication has gotten worse than it was even at the beginning of the semester.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I don't think there was much to report in terms of failure this week, the only thing I can think of is I forgot to update the agenda / spreadsheet.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I did not code as much as I liked for this weeks progress and I am failing to updates the team spreadsheet
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Barriers**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: On a personal level, both work and my other classes have made it difficult for me to commit as much time as I'd like to this project this week.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: Certain aspects of django are harder to implement than others.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There was a learning curve while trying to understand the class diagram while making the new one.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
  
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: I don't really know what to put here, other than that as a group, we haven't really been implementing our "next time" suggestions from previous reports.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: The only thing I can think of is to stay ahead on the deliverables and code the website more.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think next week we should aim to code more.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts:
