## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**: 


### **Ceanna**:
This week Jennie and I created the design pattern diagram. Her and I sat down and talked about what the best design pattern would work the best. We decided to use the structural design, adapter and the behavioral design observer. On the Tuesday meeting we all decided on the Architecture model, and then I created the diagram in drawio. I uploaded all the diagrams in the deliverable. I was in charge of notes for this week. Another thing that I did was completing the bootstrap into the code. I was working login and signing up. My main goal was to fix the format of the pages. I decided then to figure out how to use bootstrap in the code.


### **Jessica**: 
This week I focused on finishing the class diagram for the report that is due on Sunday. This required me to change our existing diagram from one that fits our code more better. I also began the researcg for the API and Django so I can start the code refactoring for next week. 


### **Chase**:
This week I was focused on getting my deliverable work done early. I decided I wanted to avoid last week's situation and get ahead on what I needed to do. I accomplished this by starting the sequence diagram early; completing the diagram itself in the beginning of the week. On top of this, I also helped design the architecture diagram and wrote the description for said architecture diagram. Once the deliverable work was done, I set out to continue working with django so that I will be better prepared for next week. I ran a few tests and found a few more online sources to further my understanding and thus prepare for the next deliverable.

## 2. Project Retrospective


### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for bringing up the idea for us to use the model for the architect, I think that this model we pick is perfect for the system. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for helping me with the sequence diagram.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate Aaron for helping me finish the diagram this week.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We planned everything well this week, and we were able to have deliverable ready to go before sunday.

   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: We weren't pressed for time like we were this time last week. I believe this made things go a lot smoother.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: We finished all the diagrams earlier than I though which really helps with the deliverable times.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Aaron deleted my branch by accident, but he was able to help me get my branch back. 

   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I don't think there was much to report in terms of failure this week, the only thing I can think of is I forgot to update the agenda / spreadsheet.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I did not code as much as I liked for this weeks progress and I am failing to updates the team spreadsheet
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
   
### **Barriers**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: There is not enough time in the days to get coding and other work done. I have things I want to get done. I feel that I need to research and code at the same time to get somewhere. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: Certain aspects of django are harder to implement than others.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There was a learning curve while trying to understand the class diagram while making the new one.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: 
  
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We should set 2 hours out of the day to work on code, so that we are not rushing for code for the next deliverable.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: The only thing I can think of is to stay ahead on the deliverables and code the website more.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think next week we should aim to code more.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts:
