## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**: 


### **Ceanna**:


### **Jessica**: 
This week I focused on finishing the class diagram for the report that is due on Sunday. This required me to change our existing diagram from one that fits our code more better. I also began the researcg for the API and Django so I can start the code refactoring for next week. 


### **Chase**:
This week I was focused on getting my deliverable work done early. I decided I wanted to avoid last week's situation and get ahead on what I needed to do. I accomplished this by starting the sequence diagram early; completing the diagram itself in the beginning of the week. On top of this, I also helped design the architecture diagram and wrote the description for said architecture diagram. Once the deliverable work was done, I set out to continue working with django so that I will be better prepared for next week. I ran a few tests and found a few more online sources to further my understanding and thus prepare for the next deliverable.
