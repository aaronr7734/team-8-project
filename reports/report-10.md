## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:

This week, I contributed to several diagrams for our deliverable by talking through them with the rest of the team. Additionally, I wrote the ``system description`` and ``design principles`` sections.
I also spent a good chunk of time trying to learn Javascript so I could provide code examples for using our REST API, but that hasn't been going too well. Front-end development isn't something I've ever been good at. I've been revisiting automated documentation and intend to have something up by Sunday.

### **Elizabeth**: 

This week, Chase and I worked together to create the sequence diagram for the upcoming deliverable, in which we focused on the case where the user tries to log in to their account. The system should behave a certain way when the user doesn't have an existing account or if the user does, they should be able to continue looking for discounts on their account. I also had a hand in deciding the architecture diagram that would better describe the structure of our system, though I ran into communications issues with one of the members in which they were uncooperative with expressing their confusion creating tension in the group. I did my best to compromise and even explained more in Thursday's meeting more in-depth about the diagram and how it suits our system more. I fixed up the HTML and CSS issues with the homepage as it did not look right. I also learned Bootstrap along the way to better our code and make it more efficient. 


### **Ceanna**:

This week Jennie and I created the design pattern diagram for the deliverable. To start the process of creating the diagrams we decided to meet up together to be able to have a productive conversation on how the diagrams should look and which design patterns would work best for the diagrams. This led us to the decision to use the structural design category using the adapter model and then from the behavioral category we wanted to use the observer model. Then, on the Tuesday meeting we as a group decided to use the Monolithic Architecture model, where I created the diagram in draw.io throughout the meeting. Once the meeting was completed and everyone agreed on the appearance of the diagram, I uploaded the diagram into the deliverable documentation. On the same note of the meeting, I recorded the notes throughout the meeting when we were not working on the diagram to keep track of what happened throughout the entirety of the meeting. After the meetings for this week, I decided to integrate some Bootstrap into our code and worked on the login and sign-up pages. Since my main goal was to fix the format of the pages and decided to build up my knowledge about Bootstrap. 

### **Jessica**: 
This week I focused on finishing the class diagram for the report that is due on Sunday. This required me to change our existing diagram from one that fits our code better. I also began the research for the API and Django so I can start the code refactoring for next week. 


### **Chase**:
This week I was focused on getting my deliverable work done early. I decided I wanted to avoid last week's situation and get ahead on what I needed to do. I accomplished this by starting the sequence diagram early; to complete the diagram itself at the beginning of the week. On top of this, I also helped design the architecture diagram and wrote the description for said architecture diagram. Once the deliverable work was done, I set out to continue working with Django so that I would be better prepared for next week. I ran a few tests and found a few more online sources to further my understanding and thus prepare for the next deliverable. 


### **Jennie**: 

This week Ceanna and I created the design pattern diagram for the deliverable. To do so, we decided to meet up outside of the meeting times to discuss what we wanted to use for the diagrams since we chose the adapter model from the structural design category and the observer model from the behavioral category. Then we went into our weekly Tuesday meeting, where we discussed the rest of the models that other group members worked on and were able to provide feedback. Since we spoke about it, this led to a rework for the architecture model since we decided to use the Monolithic Architecture instead since it works better with the concept we are using. Outside of the meetings, I worked on the HTML earlier in the week to try to line up our sketch for the home page since some parts of the original HTML did not match our sketch the previous week. 

## 2. Project Retrospective
### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Jennie for helping with the diagrams and for upholding the communication on Discord. 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for bringing up the idea for us to use the model for the architect, I think that this model we pick is perfect for the system. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna for still coming in person to our second weekly meeting despite everyone else being remote.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for helping me with the sequence diagram.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate Aaron for helping me finish the diagram this week.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I appreciate Chase and Elizabeth for producing the sequence diagram and having a successful model when it was featured in the Tuesday meeting.
   
### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: The diagrams were finished early. 
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We planned everything well this week, and we were able to have the deliverable ready to go before Sunday.

   
   Aaron's Thoughts: We got a huge chunk of Deliverable 5 done earlier than we typically do.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: We weren't pressed for time like we were this time last week. I believe this made things go a lot smoother.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: We finished all the diagrams earlier than I thought which helped with the deliverable times.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We had a great work ethic this week when it came to the creation of the diagrams.
   
### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I feel like the communication between the two teams was not very effective and the communication between frontend and backend was an absolute failure. The back end needs to work on communicating with each other more and splitting up the work more evenly so ALL members can learn the necessary skills. The frontend team needs to be more communicative on how the website should look and come to a compromise on what needs to be on the website rather than just coding things that we NEVER agreed on. We all need to learn how to compromise more as a team.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: Aaron deleted my branch by accident, but he was able to help me get my branch back. 


   Aaron's Thoughts: Within a matter of a few weeks, it feels like our communication has gotten worse than it was even at the beginning of the semester.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I don't think there was much to report in terms of failure this week, the only thing I can think of is I forgot to update the agenda/spreadsheet.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I did not code as much as I liked for this week's progress and I am failing to update the team spreadsheet.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We are having a difficult time communicating with one another since members are having thoughts but not expressing them with others. Since not everyone is communicating and expressing themselves it is causing a downfall in teamwork since front-end and back-end are not having clear communication with one another making it difficult to make progress on the website.
   
### **Barriers**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Other responsibilities have made it difficult to dedicate time to the website.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: There is not enough time in the days to get coding and other work done. I have things I want to get done. I feel that I need to research and code at the same time to get somewhere. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: On a personal level, both work and my other classes have made it difficult for me to commit as much time as I'd like to this project this week.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: Certain aspects of Django are harder to implement than others.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: There was a learning curve while trying to understand the class diagram while making the new one.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We were so focused on the deliverable this week that we did not form an official plan on what to code for the website this week. 
  
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Backend should teach frontend about API since they emphasized that API is important for them to know but have not provided any guidance or direction on how to learn it properly. 

   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: We should set 2 hours out of the day to work on code so that we are not rushing for code for the next deliverable.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: I don't know what to put here, other than that as a group, we haven't been implementing our "next time" suggestions from previous reports. 
   

   Chase's Thoughts: The only thing I can think of is to stay ahead on the deliverables and code the website more.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think next week we should aim to code more.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: Next time, we should try having a better discussion on what needs to be worked on for the website even if we have a deliverable.

   
## 3. Next Steps
Our next steps are to work on the website, start the discussion on the deliverable, and work through GitHub. When it comes to working on the website, the front end needs to make fixes to the website itself to make it more appealing and the back end needs to work on the server to update it to match what is on GitHub and show the group the functionality of the API. For the start of the discussion for the deliverable, we will probably talk about it in our Tuesday meeting. Other than that, this upcoming week will have more coding.
