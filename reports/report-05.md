## Summary of Activities

### Ceanna Jarrett

This week I created an agenda for the group meeting. This week, my main mission was to get the team back on track. I wanted to create some structure in the group. I looked up different positions that each of us could talk about. Then we had our meeting and decided to work on the report and make the deliverable. Aaron and I went to talk to the teacher to get advice, something that we took was making the reports more organized. I created homework for each of us in the group, so that we can tell what we did this week. So that the reports can become better and more detailed. This week I decided to research the website. I decided to look into the database that would work with what language would work. I am not sure which language we want to use. If we use Python we can use PlanetScale. If we work with C we can also use mysql. I know that most of us in the group can use MySQL. This database would work for the account system that we want to add to the website. This MySQL database will hold the name, email, and email address.

### Chase Babb

This week I helped revise the meeting schedule, came up with solutions to better aid our communication as a group, and provided ideas for us to better utilize github. I also researched the topic of creating website accounts and shared my findings.

### Elizabeth Knight

I researched and found frameworks/features that I thought would enhance our idea and further implemented them through selecting coding methods that show efficiency. During and after the meeting, I collaborated with my teammates in order to discuss improving teamwork and our dynamics, which will lead to a more understanding and productive work environment.

### Jennie Butch

For the research on the framework for our project, I looked up frameworks for web applications and came up with the result of the top ten frameworks for web application development. Out of the top ten, I found Django, ASP.NET, Laravel, and CodeIgniter to be our best choices for our website. These options are the best because they each use a language each member is familiar with in their way. Where Aaron is familiar with Python which is used for the Django framework. Jennie, Elizabeth, Ceanna, Chase, and Jessica are familiar with C which in some components is similar to C# so it might be difficult at first. However, with research and time, I believe the team can use C# which is the language used for the ASP.NET framework. As for Laravel and CodeIgniter, it use PHP, which Jennie, Elizabeth, and Ceanna are familiar with and should be able to use for our website. Outside of what type of languages these frameworks use, I think any of the four frameworks will be helpful for our website because they offer an easier way of coding for a website. After looking at each framework’s website, I think ASP.NET might be the most resourceful since it includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C# which are key components that go into building a web application. Additionally, it is free to use and there are plenty of YouTube videos on the material from the framework’s website itself. This is just one of many that I found interesting and helpful. I also found Django to be very helpful and interesting because it also has some videos through the website and deals with Python. Just like I said about C#, I believe that the team can refresh themselves on how to use Python since this framework does use it. Additionally, it seems easy for everyone on the team to install on their laptops.

### Jessica Maldonado Olivas

This week I was researching a feature to alter a user's recommendations based on their search history for the website. This would be more for users who are looking for common dorm items, say if they looked up bedding, a mattress pad may show up as their recommended because it is a similar item. This feature would only be available for users who create an account and log in because the information would be logged. The users that may use the website as guests would have random recommendations for discounts they may need.

### Aaron Ramirez

This week, I secured a server for hosting our website and successfully acquired the domain name studentdiscountz.org. To help our team determine the best fit, I set up several reputable web frameworks on the server, including Django and ASP.NET. I helped Ceanna organize the week's meetings, and visited the professor with her for extra guidance.  Additionally, I've proposed an approach to automate the creation of our future meeting agendas.

## Project Retrospective

The past week has proven challenging for our team, exemplified by our struggle to find a common time slot for all members to collaborate on Deliverable 3. It's become evident that our approach of dividing tasks, though well-intentioned, may not be serving our project's best interests, given the quality of outcomes. Instead of furthering our work on the deliverable amidst these constraints, we chose to redirect our energies toward introspection and thorough research. A recurring challenge we've faced is the lack of a shared vision for the project, with diverse opinions and perspectives on its direction. This week has underscored the importance of unifying our vision to ensure cohesive progress in future endeavors.

### Appreciations

- Ceanna: We would have been lost without your agenda.

### Successes

- Gained clearer understanding of our project goals.
- Acknowledged the effectiveness of structured agendas for focus.

### Failures

- Lack of effective coordination among team members.
- Communication breakdowns led to misunderstandings and missed opportunities.
- Inability to dedicate time and resources to work on Deliverable 3.
- The team operated with fragmented visions rather than a unified direction.

### Barriers

- Scheduling conflicts preventing longer team meetings.
- Fragmented visions and ideas about the project direction.
- Ineffective task delegation leading to subpar deliverable quality.
- Challenges in consistent and clear communication among team members.

### Improvements for Next Time

- **In-Person Meetings:** To foster better communication and productivity, we'll be holding in-person meetings for the foreseeable future, as remote sessions often lead to confusion and frustration.

- **Structured Agenda with GitHub:** A weekly agenda will be maintained on GitHub. At the conclusion of each meeting, a new issue will be initiated for team members to comment on potential discussion points for the subsequent meeting. These comments will be addressed in the following session, post which the issue will be closed, and a fresh one will be initiated for the next meeting.

- **Unified Work Approach:** We'll abstain from dividing tasks that significantly influence the direction of our project, ensuring a cohesive vision and output.

## Next Steps

In the coming week, we have a clear roadmap. We've planned two group meetings to collectively tackle our deliverable. Simultaneously, members are diving into web frameworks to identify our best options. Furthermore, there's a shared effort to become more comfortable with Git, aiming to integrate it into our process sooner rather than later.
