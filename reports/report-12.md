## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**: 
For this week, I updated the picture on our homepage for the website in order to make it better reflect the team's current goal. I also worked on my portion of the deliverabler by adding and fully installling Selenium to my local machine and made tests to check if the login and sign-up pages work properly. I have plans to update the tests I have now and create new ones later in the week so that I can ensure that more of the website's functionalities are also working. Additionally, I have researched the basics of jQuery so that I can better understand the API functions on the frontend side of our website. I can say that while I researched, jQuery seems to be very straightforward with its syntax.\
The research has been useful in understanding how our data retrieval process can be better optimized so that our website can gather the necessary information more efficiently.


### **Ceanna**:


### **Jessica**: 


### **Chase**:
This week I primarily focused on research. We decided to use Selenium for our acceptance tests and so I researched and installed selenium so that I may develop further acceptance tests. I plan to better my understanding of these tests so that I can help ensure the functionalities of the website. I also began looking into developing the search capabilities for our website. I researched and experimented with our current database in an attempt to develop code that could pull data from said database. The intent is to use the keywords entered by the user in the search and reference the database for matches. While I have not quite figured it out yet, I should be able to relatively soon. I believe this week was productive as the research I conducted should prove to make the programming for next week more efficient. I am hoping that because of this, I will be able to come up with more acceptance tests and create the fully functional search application.
