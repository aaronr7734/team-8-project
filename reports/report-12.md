## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:


### **Elizabeth**: 
For this week, I updated the picture on our homepage for the website in order to make it better reflect the team's current goal. I also worked on my portion of the deliverabler by adding and fully installling Selenium to my local machine and made tests to check if the login and sign-up pages work properly. I have plans to update the tests I have now and create new ones later in the week so that I can ensure that more of the website's functionalities are also working. Additionally, I have researched the basics of jQuery so that I can better understand the API functions on the frontend side of our website. I can say that while I researched, jQuery seems to be very straightforward with its syntax.\
The research has been useful in understanding how our data retrieval process can be better optimized so that our website can gather the necessary information more efficiently.
