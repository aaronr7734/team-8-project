## 1. Summary of Activities

### **Aaron**:
This week, I researched and learned the basics of writing tests using the Django REST Framework's automated testing module. I began work on some tests that create student accounts, bookmark discounts, etc, as required by Deliverable 7. Additionally, I helped a few teammates get logged into the server so they could update the website and test Javascript on their own.

### **Elizabeth**: 
For this week, I updated the picture on our homepage for the website to make it better reflect the team's current goal. I also worked on my portion of the deliverable by adding and fully installing Selenium to my local machine and made tests to check if the login and sign-up pages worked properly. I have plans to update the tests I have now and create new ones later in the week so that I can ensure that more of the website's functionalities are also working. Additionally, I have researched the basics of jQuery so that I can better understand the API functions on the front-end side of our website. I can say that while I researched, jQuery seems to be very straightforward with its syntax. The research has been useful in understanding how our data retrieval process can be better optimized so that our website can gather the necessary information more efficiently.


### **Ceanna**:
This week, we had a meeting with everyone. We talked about communication and how to break down the jobs for the next deliverable. We also talked about what we each need to code for the next two weeks. Because of the holidays, we were not able to code the most this week. However, I was able to code JavaScript and jQuery for the discounts on the website. There is some trial and error to make it work. I log into the server so I can become familiar with the server. So that I will be able to test it. I am working on this code with Jennie and Elizabeth. Jennie helped me with the login page and the signup page. For the deliverable, I am working with Elizabeth and Chase on the acceptance test. I looked into all the different testing software, and we decided to use Selenium. We are going to work more on it over the next week. At the same time, we are going to code to make sure that the website is up to date. 


### **Jessica**: 
This week we broke down what we needed for the rest of the project since the project's final is coming up for presentation. This week was a lot of research on my part trying to get the signup page and login page to work with one another. Since I am still unfamiliar with the API this has been challenging but I am looking into alternative options with jQuery. I also started the implementation of the c aspect which we changed from the original plan.

### **Chase**:
This week I primarily focused on research. We decided to use Selenium for our acceptance tests so I researched and installed Selenium so that I may develop further acceptance tests. I plan to better my understanding of these tests so that I can help ensure the functionalities of the website. I also began looking into developing the search capabilities for our website. I researched and experimented with our current database in an attempt to develop code that could pull data from said database. The intent is to use the keywords entered by the user in the search and reference the database for matches. While I have not quite figured it out, I should be able to relatively soon. This week was productive as the research I conducted should prove to make the programming for next week more efficient. I am hoping that because of this, I will be able to come up with more acceptance tests and create a fully functional search application.


### **Jennie**: 
This week I mainly focused on working on the signup/login pages to make them look more presentable, it is still a work in progress but it is looking better. I want to try to continue our image from the home page onto the signup/login pages and have it fade out in the background is my idea right now. Otherwise, we focused on making a plan for the following two weeks and what needs to get done.

## 2. Project Retrospective
### **Appreciations**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I appreciate Ceanna and Jennie for helping me with the jQuery aspect of the website.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizbeth for working on the login and the signup pages for the acceptance testing. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: I appreciate the whole team for coming in on Tuesday to discuss issues professionally. I feel like we're finally headed in the right direction.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for helping me with Selenium.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I appreciate the whole team this week for being able to talk through professional communication.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I appreciate Elizabeth for working with me on the home page and the discussion of the appearance of the signup page.

   
### **Successes**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think that we had a more successful time assigning the work more evenly this time.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think that we are doing a lot better in the communication area for our team. We are working as a team to make sure that everyone is on the same page, and making sure that no one is behind. 
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: Communication was great, we did a good job assigning tasks, and things are overall feeling better than they ever have.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I think we are using our time more efficiently this week.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think the assignment distribution was great this week.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: I think we have a better idea about what needs to get done and when it needs to be.
   
### **Failures**: 

   Elizabeth's Thoughts: Since Thanksgiving was this week, it was harder to get work done and on time.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I am having a hard time with Fetch and post in JavaScript. There are too many things that need to happen to make it work. The work needs to break down to the logic of what we are doing.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: Holidays and being sick have made it harder to get work done.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I did not code much this week and instead spent more time researching and experimenting.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Managing the task I had to get things done on time was a challenge.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: This week was difficult to be as productive as we wanted to be.
   
   
### **Barriers**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think time is the main barrier that we're dealing with right now since the holidays got in the way of progress.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I had a hard time trying to figure out where the API link for fetch was. The names on the GitHub of the server and the API are different. It took a couple of hours to figure out where the link was supposed to go.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: I have nothing to say here that hasn't already been said.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: I think we still have a lot to get done in very little time and I'm worried about getting everything done.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: I think trying to implement a C function on a website was very difficult.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We have to go headstrong into this week since this weekend was difficult to be as active as we wanted to be.
   
   
### **What Should We Try Next Time**: 
  
   Elizabeth's Thoughts: I think that next time we could dedicate more time to getting more progress done with the website.
   
   
   Ceanna's Thoughts: I think in our next meeting we need to figure out the same details of the website, so that when it comes to the big features of the website. We can figure it out.
   

   Aaron's Thoughts: I think for our next few meetings we need to use them as work time so we can all work in the same space.
   

   Chase's Thoughts: We should research further in advance so that we have more time to code.
   
   
   Jessica's Thoughts: Next time we can look at the website as a whole and see what needs to be done.
   
   
   Jennie's Thoughts: We should be more consistent on what we want and be able to maintain a good deadline since time has gotten the better of us.
   
   
## 3. Next Steps
As we go into this week, we have the focus on maintaining better deadlines and check-ins to be more productive and communicative as a team. From last week's meeting, we were able to get ahead and assign teams for different parts of the deliverable and have made sure that everyone is in communication with one another and that the work is fairly distributed. We seemed to like the idea of making some meeting times a work time where we focus on coding since we maintain discussion for less than an hour and then we can just focus on coding from there. This provides a better opportunity for discussion on the code rather than communicating over Discord so it is not as difficult to achieve productivity. Otherwise, our main goal for this week is to complete the deliverable before Sunday since we have plenty of opportunities to work on our parts through our normally scheduled meeting times.
