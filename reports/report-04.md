### 1. Summary of Activities

Week four of the project included coming up with specific use cases and product aspects that we would like to focus on. The team worked both together and 
seperatly on different task in order to finish the deliverable document to set us up for coding next week.

- **Jessica**: Took care of formatting the deliverable and coming up with ideas for 6 and 7 on the deliverable requirements
- **Ceanna**: We worked on the derivable this week. We practiced taking the work and separating it to everyone. We as a group have decided to take about commutation and organization.
- **Aaron**: Set up the server and domain (collegediscountz.org). Wrote section 1 along with the other parts of the report we all contributed to, and converted deliverable to md, pdf
- **Chase**: Worked on the deliverable, filling out required parts 
- **Elizabeth**: focused on completing my assigned tasks for the report and also brainstormed additional features that could enhance the deliverable's functionality.
- **Jennie**: Worked on the deliverable, filling out required parts 


### 2. Project Retrospective 

- **Appreciations**: The whole team was able to come together and communicate in a more efficient way on what needed to get done for the cases on the second deliverable
- **Successess**: The team all finished their parts on what needed to be done and posted everyhting accordingly
- **Failures**: Trying to format the images on the deliverable as well as everyone understanding what their specific role was for the week was challenging
- **Barriers**: Trying to find correct formatting for everyones contributions to the document. Merge errors were a potential problem so we took a different apprach that seemed very redundent 
- **What we should try next time:**: Actually using github would be very much more helpful and help manage the team a bit better

### 3. Next Steps

Next Steps: Coding implementation. The domain was bought now we are going to create the roles and assignments for the website
