### 1. Summary of activities

Ceanna, Chase, Jennie and Elizabeth worked on names for the website. Aaron is working on getting the server up before Sunday. 
Jennie is suggesting to start on HTML first in order to get first. Jess is describing the layout of the site and splitting up the pages. 
Each section of what we do could be on the homepage is being decided on. We are deciding to start on the second deliverable in order to 
get a better idea of what we need to do for the upcoming week. 


### 2. Project retrospective

With the group so far, we have discussed how we're currently facing several communication issues. 
These issues have prevented us from communicating our thoughts about the project and our expectations about what needs to be done. 
In order to properly address these issues, we have decided to check in more often and provide more detailed reports to ensure that 
misunderstandings are cleared up and everyone is on the same page. It has been brought to our attention that we need to assess what roles 
suit us best in order to improve group dynamics and possibly add more roles so that the foundational roles feel more supported. It was also 
brought up that we need to start establishing current agendas in order to stay focused on what needs to be done first. Another member talked 
about how we need to have more inclusive discussions, avoid talking over each other, and rethink how we distribute responsibilities. 
Finally, we discussed the importance of our deliverables and that they should be read thoroughly before and after the meeting.

1. Appreciations: Thanks CJ and Chase for trying to come up with names. Jennie and Jess did a good job of trying to keep us on track.
2. Successes:  N/A
3. Failures: We don’t have a server up and we don’t have a name yet. 
4. Barriers: Communication issues and no solid agenda.
5. Read deliverables, conduct check ins, assign permanent roles, be more inclusive 


### 3. Next steps

Next meeting:

* Complete sections of the deliverable

* Decide on infrastructure we want to use
