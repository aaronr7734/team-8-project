## Licensing (Chase)
We decided to use the MIT License for our project, Student Discountz. We favored the MIT License because it maintains a good balance between openness and simplicity. It offers developers and organizations the freedom to use and contribute to projects while minimizing legal and compliance concerns. We believe this to be important considering this is a class project and therefore we do not need anything fancy or overbearing.

## Readme File (Elizabeth)


## Look & Feel (Chase)
For our UI, we decided to try to give our users a flexible yet thorough interface that will allow them to find various discounts through various means. A few of our functional utilities include a drop down filter by major, a search bar, and a search by category section. We believe this will give users adequate discount searching capabilities. We also included login and sign up pages that will allow users to access more selective features in the future. While our current features are functional, they are not currently looking the way we want them to and thus will be updated further at a later date.
