# Team Project - D.4 Implementation

**Team:** 8 - StudentDiscountz

## Introduction (Ceanna & Jennie)

StudentDiscountz is a website designed for college students looking for a discount. This makes it easier for students to save money by centralizing student-specific discounts, especially from small local businesses. One of the key features of this website is the search bar. The search bar can be used so that students can search for a particular brand or deal they are looking for. Additionally, if they use the filter button they can look for a particular major that would use that type of material. Another feature of this website is to allow students to create an account so they can have a login account to narrow down what type of discounts they like. On the home page itself, students can find any discount, and even some by category. The category feature will redirect students to another page where they can find more discounts on a more materialist level like dorm room decorations or even book deals. Overall, this system is an easier way for students to find discounts on supplies they use every day.

## Deployment (Aaron)


## Licensing (Chase)
We decided to use the MIT License for our project, Student Discountz. We favored the MIT License because it maintains a good balance between openness and simplicity. It offers developers and organizations the freedom to use and contribute to projects while minimizing legal and compliance concerns. We believe this to be important considering this is a class project and therefore we do not need anything fancy or overbearing.
