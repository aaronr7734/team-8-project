## Licensing (Chase)
We decided to use the MIT License for our project, Student Discountz. We favored the MIT License because it maintains a good balance between openness and simplicity. It offers developers and organizations the freedom to use and contribute to projects while minimizing legal and compliance concerns. We believe this to be important considering this is a class project and therefore we do not need anything fancy or overbearing.
