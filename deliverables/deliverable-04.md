# Team Project - D.4 Implementation

**Team:** 8 - StudentDiscountz

## Introduction 

StudentDiscountz is a website designed for college students looking for a discount. This makes it easier for students to save money by centralizing student-specific discounts, especially from small local businesses. One of the key features of this website is the search bar. The search bar can be used so that students can search for a particular brand or deal they are looking for. Additionally, if they use the filter button they can look for a particular major that would use that type of material. Another feature of this website is to allow students to create an account so they can have a login account to narrow down what type of discounts they like. On the home page itself, students can find any discount, and even some by category. The category feature will redirect students to another page where they can find more discounts on a more materialist level like dorm room decorations or even book deals. Overall, this system is an easier way for students to find discounts on supplies they use every day.

## Tests (Aaron)


## Adopted Technologies 
GitHub: We use GitHub to store code, deliverables, and reports concerning the website. GitHub allows us to build our project from the ground up by giving us the ability to individually add to the website in one centralized area.

Discord: This is our main form of communication outside of GitHub. We use this to plan meetings, ask questions, assign deadlines, and overall discuss any beneficial topic to our website.

Excel: We use an Excel spreadsheet to assign work and reference what we have done throughout the week. This allows us to form a more effective agenda and keep track of who did what.

Django: This will be the backend framework that we will use. Django is a good framework for backend website development due to its ease of use, available tools, versatility, and development capabilities.

Bootstrap: This will be the frontend framework that we will use. Bootstrap is a good framework for the front end due to its HTML and CSS support as well as its responsive design, browser compatibility, and accessibility.

JavaScript: We will use JavaScript to help with the API. Javascript fits best given HTML and the API that is required to accomplish this task. We found that Javascript offers simple API integration while allowing for custom functionality.


## Learning/Training 

When it came to the adopted technologies, everyone had their way of providing for the team using these tools. For starters, everyone on the team used GitHub as a way to communicate our issues for this project. The team also used GitHub as a source to communicate the code that everyone was working on. We all managed to pull and merge to keep the team on the same page about how the appearance of the website should look and its functionalities. Since GitHub is our main source to communicate about our coding files and at times what we need to accomplish, when it comes to actually speaking to each other we all use Discord. The main goal of our use of Discord is to plan meetings and ask questions. Additionally, it is our key component to communicating with each other about the website like who is doing their part and if they run into an issue to tell someone about it. For our next learning aspect, we had Aaron, Chase, and Jessica also known as our back-end team, use Django for some of their coding this week. Django made it easier to code certain parts of their code this week and found it to be very useful for the tasks that were assigned to them. In a similar situation with the front-end team, Elizabeth, Jennie, and Ceanna worked with Bootstrap to make it easier to code for the HTML and CSS side of the website, where it was made easier to see what was occurring on the website. Lastly, when JavaScript was being used, Aaron used it this week to be able to help with the API. Since JavaScript offers an API integration that allows custom functionality which makes it easier for Aaron to do his task for the server and website in general. 


## Deployment (Aaron)


## Licensing
We decided to use the MIT License for our project, Student Discountz. We favored the MIT License because it maintains a good balance between openness and simplicity. It offers developers and organizations the freedom to use and contribute to projects while minimizing legal and compliance concerns. We believe this to be important considering this is a class project and therefore we do not need anything fancy or overbearing.

## Look & Feel 
For our UI, we decided to give our users a flexible yet thorough interface that will allow them to find various discounts through various means. A few of our functional utilities include a drop-down filter by major, a search bar, and a search by category-section. We believe this will give users adequate discount searching capabilities. We also included login and sign-up pages that will allow users to access more selective features in the future. While our current features are functional, they are not currently looking the way we want them to and thus will be updated further at a later date.

## Lessons Learned
We accomplished a lot with our first release, we went from nothing to a decent website. This first release may not be a complete version but is a great starting point. We have learned a lot, especially from working on this deliverable what we need to do in the future. For the front-end team, we learned how to refresh ourselves on HTML and CSS coding since the whole front-end has not touched it in about a year. So it took us a minute to remember how it works and what we needed to do for the home page itself. In addition, we learned how to implement a framework into the code which is something we have not done before, and found it to be resourceful. As for the back-end team, we learned a lot more than we were expecting, Aaron worked on the server for the website which was very helpful. He then worked on the API using JavaScript which seemed to be easier to use the front-end's code that was already there to integrate with it. Not only did the back-end work on the API, Jessica and Chase managed to create links to other pages that we plan on working on in the future. In this release, we managed to at least allow the user to click and be able to go onto another page. In the next version, the other pages will look better in appearance compared to this release. Our main plan for the next release is to clean up the home page. The home page has a decent appearance right now but it can be cleaned up. We also need more detail on our other pages since they are still in the skeleton stage where we have just what we need but no real design to it. Lastly, we need to rework our code a little bit since there was no real coding standard this time around but for the next release, we want to so others can interpret the code easily and run much smoother about how front-end and back-end work together.
