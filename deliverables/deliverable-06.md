## Tests

## Demo

## Code Quality

## Lessons Learned
With our website's second release, we've made a bunch of new changes. Starting with the homepage, we've got a more professional header now. Also, we added a "Hot Deal" section with all sorts of discounts.

For the login and sign-up pages, we changed them up because they didn't look professional enough. We learned that spending more time on these pages makes a better user experience. We added a link to the login page on the sign-up page, and vice versa, for those who are already users. We also put in a home button to make it easier to move around the website.

On the backend and the API, we figured out a lot more once we really got into the code. We had a tough time with design patterns at first, but after working with the code, it started to make sense.

Communication has been tricky for us. Sometimes what we want to say gets lost or misunderstood. We're learning to adjust to these problems. When we plan what to code, we make sure everyone understands and has the opportunity to ask questions during our meetings. We're trying our best to keep everyone on the same page so no one falls behind.

We’ve been struggling with JavaScript, especially when it comes to pulling discounts from the API. JavaScript is new for most of us, and maybe it was a tough choice for this project.  If we continue this project after this class is over, we want to get better at JavaScript, make sure we're all talking the same language, and get the website to do what we originally outlined in previous deliverables.
