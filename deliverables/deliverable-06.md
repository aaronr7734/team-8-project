## Lessons Learned
With the second release of the website, the website has gone through a couple of new changes. To start with the home pages, we learned how to make the header more professional. Another thing we learned was how to add the â€œHot Deal '', in the hot deals are all the discounts that are miscellaneous. For the login and sign up pages we changed how the login and sign up pages looked. We as a group decided that the pages were not looking as professional as we wanted them to be. We learned that taking the time on those pages helps create a better experience for the user.One of the applications that we add was a link to the login page from the sign in page if you were already a user, vice versa. Another thing we realized for the user that would be helpful to go around in the website is a home button. To be able to back and forth. For the backend on the api, we learned that we you sit down with the code, we were able to have a better understanding of the website.We had a hard time with pattern design patterns, till we sat down with the code to figure out what we were doing wrong. We needed to look at the code to be able to see the design. We learned that communication is very hard. We have a hard time communicating what needs to be communicated with it getting lost or confused. We are learning how to adjust when we have these problems. For example when we are planning what to code, there was communication on what would happen. So when that happened, we stopped as a group and made sure that we knew as a group in our meeting. And we as a group are trying to communicate as best as we can so that one of us falls behind in code.  We have learned that we have a hard time with javascript. It is creating a difficult time when we are creating the discounts from the API. We still are going to try and make the javascript to work for it to be able to grab the discount from the API. Javascript is a new language for most of us. We learned that we might have picked the hard choice when we decided to work with javascript. What we would change if this project is still continuing would be to get the discount from the API, and more of the other pages up and running. We think that as a group we would take more time to work on the javascript and making sure that the group is communicating so that we do not have any mess up in the future. Also make sure that the website is doing the thing that we wanted it to do in the beginning.
