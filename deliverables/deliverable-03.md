# Team Project - D.2 Requirements

**Team:** 8 - CollegeDiscountz

## System Description

Navigating scattered and unreliable **student** **discounts** is a time-consuming hassle. CollegeDiscountz is a web-based aggregator that centralizes **Student**-centric **Discounts**, making it the go-to platform for budget-conscious scholars. Unlike Unidays, we offer a simple, clean interface with **major**-specific ***filters***, serving as an essential money-saving tool for **students**.

**Users** can register through a simple ***sign-up*** process that asks for an *email address*, and *password*. It then ***verifies*** whether they are a **Student** or **Admin**. Once inside, they're greeted by an easily navigable dashboard that centralizes the latest **discounts** with the *name* of the business, its *location*, and a *link* to their website if applicable.

**Students** can utilize a robust ***search function*** to scour for deals based on **category** or their **major**. They can **Bookmark** favorites for later perusal or ***activate*** **notifications** to alert them of new **Discounts** in **categories** of interest. For those who want more fine-grained control, ***filters*** allow **Students** to sort **Discounts** based on *location*, **category**, **Major**, and more.

Behind the scenes, **Admins** have the power to ***activate*** or ***deactivate*** **Discounts**, ensuring only the most relevant and functional offers are available. They also provide **Discounts**, complete with *links* to websites, that get shown to **Students**. **admins** can also **send notifications** or make *announcements* to **Students**, keeping them in the loop about the latest deals or updates.

To save their favorites for another time, **Students** can create **Bookmarks** using the *name* and *URL* of the business, which get stored in their user profile for future reference. **Notifications** are generated automatically based on *user preferences* and are sent via *email* to keep **Students** informed.
