## Acceptance Test (Elizabeth, Chase, Ceanna)
For the acceptance testing process of our website, we decided to use the Selenium framework utilizing Python, which also required us to download specific web
drivers for the different browsers that we each use. We have five automated tests in total, that each test different aspects of our website, which include
logging in, signing in, navigating to our GitHub through the Contact Us page, clicking on the different majors through the dropdown and clicking on their 
'View Deal' buttons and navigating through the different deal tabs on our homepage. 

1. Logging in
   Link to test: [login test](./acceptance_tests/login_test.py)

   The user would go to our website, navigate to the login in page and put in their email and password and click on the submit button.
   They should then see a little pop up that welcomes them back and it redirects them to the homepage.

3. Signing up
   Link to test: [sign in test](./acceptance_tests/signup_test.py)

   This test shows the user navigating to our website and to the sign up page where they encouraged to provide their name, email, and to create a new
   password that is within our requirements. When they sign up, the user should be able to see a little pop up that states that they signed up.
   
5. Navigating home page
