# Team Project - D.7 Verification and Validation

**Team:** 8 - StudentDiscountz

## Description
StudentDiscountz is a website for students trying to save some money with designated scholarly discounts. The website's key feature centralizes student-specific discounts, enabling users to locate items they need for a cheaper price. The home page allows users to have a more general sense of discounts offered and even split some discounts by category. This allows deals like technology and dorm supplies to be separated for ease of use for the user. On top of that, they are also able to locate major specific discounts if the discount they want falls outside the general categories that the home page offers. The login and signup functionalities also allow users to come back and visit the discounts they had previously seen as well. Overall, StudentDiscountz simplifies the student shopping experience with centralized discounts, convenient discount categories, and a user-friendly login feature for personalized preferences. 

## Verification

## Acceptance Test

## Validation

The user evaluations were split into three main individual tasks. Each of these tasks hit a major portion of the website's features. They were split into Authentication, Navigation, and Satisfaction.

## Authentication
The first task of “Authentication” included the users testing the Signing up and Logging in functionalities of the website. The main objective is to test the ability to locate the designated pages, the ease of use of the process, and the functionality of sending the data to the API.

### General Process ###
1. Visit the website’s homepage
2. Locate the designated sign-up page and sign up
3. Locate the login page and log in
4. Check if user data is available to the API

### Questions ###
1. How would you rate the navigation of our website? (Scale: Very Difficult - Very Easy)
2. Were you satisfied with the confirmation or welcome messages after signing up?
3. Would you reuse the system in the current state it is in right now or would improvements make it feel better?

### Data Collected ### 
1. “Very easy like I said before everything is visible and everything runs smooth”
2. “Yes, this just reassured me that the process worked instead of just being redirected”
3. “If there is anything to improve on it would be a larger library of options.”

## Navigation 
The next task of “Navigation” included the users testing the actual pages and discounts offered. This included not only the main pages but also the tabs leading to the different areas of interest and the discounts the links may redirect the user to. The main objective of this task is to evaluate the user’s experience with the selections and products offered, and whether the system provides an adequate capability for user handling. 

### General Process ###
1. Once redirected to the homepage, browse the deals located on the page
2. Explore the options specific to “Dorms”, “Books”, etc on the home page
3. Locate the major tab
4. Locate major of interest (if applicable) and browse discounts

### Questions ### 
1. The general idea of this website is to allow users to have a friendly user interface in order to find the discounts they may need. Do you feel as though you were able to find your major of interest? 
2. Does the homepage feel welcoming enough to keep looking at different areas of the website? 
3. If applicable, which specific pages did you find most useful or engaging?
4. Did the website’s design enhance or hinder your experience?
Were there any pages that you found confusing or less helpful? 

### Data Collected ### 
1. “Yes, I was able to find my major but this is nowhere near the whole lot that users may want to find discounts for.”
2. “It looks very approachable and professional and looks like a safe space to operate”
3. “I would say the majors of study because you really dive in on what’s available”
4. “Made it simple to navigate and everything was on display”
5. “To my knowledge no there wasn’t.”
